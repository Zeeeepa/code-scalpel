   - Compliance frameworks (PCI-DSS, SOC2, HIPAA)
   - Cryptographic policy verification
   - Tamper-proof policy signatures
 
2. **Advanced Security**
   - Cross-file taint tracking (trace vulnerabilities across 10+ files)
   - Reachability analysis (is vulnerable code actually called?)
   - Priority finding ordering (business impact + technical severity)
   - Bug reproduction from crash logs
 
3. **Type Safety at Scale**
   - Type evaporation analysis with runtime validation
   - API contract validation (frontend/backend compatibility)
   - Zod schema generation from TypeScript types
   - Network boundary analysis
 
4. **Governance & Compliance**
   - Compliance report generation
   - Audit trails with MCP analytics
   - License management (JWT-based)
   - Organization-wide policy enforcement
 
5. **Enterprise Infrastructure**
   - Files up to 100MB
   - Custom rules engine
   - Integration with CI/CD pipelines
   - SSO and user management (roadmap)
 
**Real-world scenarios**:
- **Scenario 1**: Compliance audit preparation
  - Run `code_policy_check` against SOC2 standards
  - Generate compliance report for auditors
  - Fix violations with `simulate_refactor`
 
- **Scenario 2**: M&A due diligence
  - Scan acquired codebase for vulnerabilities
  - Cross-file taint tracking for critical flows
  - Reachability analysis to prioritize fixes
 
- **Scenario 3**: API breaking change detection
  - Validate frontend/backend type contracts
  - Generate Zod schemas for runtime validation
  - Prevent type evaporation across service boundaries
 
**Key talking points**:
- "Enterprise tier is for organizations with compliance requirements"
- "Custom policies enforce your org's standards automatically"
- "Cross-file taint tracking finds vulnerabilities others miss"
- "Reachability analysis reduces noise by 80%"
- "ROI: Avoid one compliance violation = years of Enterprise tier"
