## 📋 Universal Opening (2 minutes)
 
Use this opening for ALL presentations:
 
### The Problem
 
**Script**:
> "AI code assistants like Claude and GitHub Copilot are incredibly powerful - but they have a fundamental limitation. When you ask them about your code, they need to read the entire file. For a 500-line file, that's ~10,000 tokens. For a 5,000-line file, that's 100,000 tokens. This is expensive, slow, and often exceeds context limits."
>
> "Worse, when the AI sees too much irrelevant code, it hallucinates. It gets confused by code that's not related to your question. The solution? Don't show the AI everything - show it exactly what it needs."
 
### The Solution
 
**Script**:
> "Code Scalpel is an MCP server that gives AI assistants surgical precision. Instead of reading entire files, it extracts just the functions, classes, or code blocks you need. This reduces token usage by 200x, eliminates hallucinations, and makes AI assistants dramatically more accurate."
>
> "But it's not just about extraction. Code Scalpel provides 19 tools for code analysis, security scanning, project navigation, refactoring, and testing. Think of it as a Swiss Army knife for AI-powered development."
 
**Visual**: Show the token efficiency graphic:
```
WITHOUT Code Scalpel:
📄 Full file → 10,000 tokens → $0.15 per query → Slow, expensive
 
WITH Code Scalpel:
🎯 Extracted function → 50 tokens → $0.0075 per query → Fast, cheap
```

   - 200x reduction in AI API costs
   - Faster responses, better accuracy
 
4. **"No strings attached"**
   - Use commercially
   - No license restrictions
   - Upgrade only when you need advanced features
 
**Objection Handling**:
- **Q: "What's the catch?"**
  - A: "No catch. We want developers using Code Scalpel. When you grow or need advanced features, we have Pro and Enterprise tiers. But you're never forced to upgrade."
 
- **Q: "50 findings seems low"**
  - A: "For most files, 50 findings is plenty. If you're regularly hitting that limit, you probably have a massive codebase and should consider Pro. But 95% of users never hit the limit."
 
---
 
### Pro Tier ($29-49/month)
 
**When to Emphasize**:
- Engineering teams (5-50 developers)
- Startups with production codebases
- Anyone hitting Community tier limits
 
**Key Messages**:
1. **"Unlimited analysis for unlimited files"**
   - No 50-finding cap
   - Files up to 10MB
   - Perfect for large codebases
 
2. **"70% fewer false positives"**
   - Sanitizer recognition
   - Confidence scoring
   - Prioritize real issues
 
3. **"Modern attack detection"**
   - NoSQL injection
   - LDAP injection
   - Secret detection
   - Beyond OWASP Top 10
 
4. **"Faster remediation"**
   - Fix snippets included
   - Copy-paste solutions
   - Hours → minutes
 
5. **"ROI: Pays for itself immediately"**
   - Find one critical bug = $50K+ breach cost avoided
   - Save 10 hours/month = $1,000+ in developer time
   - Break-even: Week 1
 
**Objection Handling**:
- **Q: "Can we just upgrade when we need it?"**
  - A: "Absolutely! Pro is month-to-month. Upgrade for a big project, downgrade after. No commitment."
 
- **Q: "Our team is small, do we need Pro?"**
  - A: "Ask yourself: Do you hit the 50-finding limit? Do you want secret detection? Do you need unlimited analysis? If yes to any, Pro adds value. If not, Community tier is perfect."
 
- **Q: "How is this different from Snyk/SonarQube?"**
  - A: "Those are CI/CD tools that run in pipelines. Code Scalpel is an MCP server that makes your AI assistant smarter in real-time. Use both! Code Scalpel finds issues as you write code, before you commit."

### Enterprise Tier (Custom Pricing)
 
**When to Emphasize**:
- Large organizations (50+ developers)
- Regulated industries (FinTech, HealthTech, GovTech)
- Companies with compliance requirements (SOC2, PCI-DSS, HIPAA)
- Organizations with custom security policies
 
**Key Messages**:
1. **"Cross-file intelligence finds what others miss"**
   - Trace vulnerabilities across 10+ files
   - Single-file analysis misses 40% of real issues
   - Enterprise tier sees the full picture
 
2. **"Custom policies = your standards enforced automatically"**
   - Not just OWASP - your organization's requirements
   - Cryptographically signed policies (tamper-proof)
   - Consistent enforcement across all developers
 
3. **"Compliance automation saves weeks of audit prep"**
   - SOC2, PCI-DSS, HIPAA reports auto-generated
   - Auditor-ready evidence
   - $92,400 saved per audit (vs manual prep)
 
4. **"Reachability analysis = 80% less triage time"**
   - 100 findings → 12 actually exploitable
   - Prioritize by what attackers can reach
   - Fix what matters, ignore what doesn't
 
5. **"Type safety across your entire stack"**
   - Detect type evaporation at API boundaries
   - Generate runtime validation schemas
   - Prevent mass assignment and type confusion
 
6. **"ROI: Audit savings alone justify the cost"**
   - One audit prep = $92K saved
   - Breach prevention = $4.45M saved
   - Developer productivity = $337K/month saved
   - Enterprise tier pays for itself many times over
 
**Objection Handling**:
- **Q: "Can we run this on-premise?"**
  - A: "Yes. Enterprise tier supports on-premise deployment for data residency requirements."
 
- **Q: "What if we only need custom policies, not the other features?"**
  - A: "We can customize your Enterprise tier. Let's discuss your specific needs and build a package that fits."
 
- **Q: "How long does implementation take?"**
  - A: "For most organizations, 1-2 weeks. We provide dedicated onboarding support, help writing custom policies, and integrate with your CI/CD pipelines."
 
- **Q: "Do you have case studies from similar companies?"**
  - A: "Yes. [Share case studies from FinTech/HealthTech/etc. in your industry]. We can also connect you with reference customers."

## 📊 Universal ROI Framework
 
Use this framework to calculate ROI for any audience:
 
### ROI Formula
 
```
Annual Cost: [Tier price] × 12 months
 
Annual Value:
  + Security breach prevention: $4.45M (avg breach cost) × probability
  + Developer time saved: [hours/month] × $100-150/hour × 12 months
  + Audit prep savings: $92K per audit × [audits/year]
  + False positive reduction: [hours saved] × $100/hour × 12 months
  + Faster onboarding: [hours saved per new dev] × [new devs/year] × $100/hour
 
ROI = (Annual Value - Annual Cost) / Annual Cost × 100%
```
 
### Example Calculations
 
**Community Tier (Free)**:
```
Cost: $0
Value:
  + Token savings: $500/month × 12 = $6,000/year
  + Bug prevention: 1 critical bug found = $50,000
Total Value: $56,000
ROI: ∞ (free tier!)
```
 
**Pro Tier ($49/month = $588/year)**:
```
Cost: $588
Value:
  + Token savings: $1,000/month × 12 = $12,000
  + Time savings: 10 hours/month × $100 × 12 = $12,000
  + Bug prevention: 1 critical bug = $50,000
Total Value: $74,000
ROI: 12,476% (pays for itself 125x)
```
 
**Enterprise Tier ($500/seat/month × 50 seats = $300,000/year)**:
```
Cost: $300,000
Value:
  + Audit prep savings: $92,000 × 2 audits = $184,000
  + Developer productivity: 45 hrs/month × 50 devs × $150 × 12 = $4,050,000
  + Breach prevention: $4.45M × 20% probability = $890,000
Total Value: $5,124,000
ROI: 1,608% (pays for itself 17x)
```
 
**Present these numbers confidently** - they're based on industry averages and conservative estimates.
