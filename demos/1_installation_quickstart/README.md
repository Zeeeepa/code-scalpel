- Claude Desktop (or MCP-compatible client)
 
---
 
## 🎬 Demo Script
 
### Step 1: Installation (30 seconds)
 
**Narration**:
> "Let's install Code Scalpel. It's available on PyPI, so installation is just one command."
 
**Commands**:
```bash
# Option A: Using pip
pip install codescalpel
 
# Option B: Using uvx (recommended for isolated environments)
uvx code-scalpel --version
 
# Verify installation
python -m code_scalpel --version
```
 
**Expected Output**:
```
Code Scalpel v1.0.0
MCP Server Ready
```
 
**Talking Points**:
- ✅ No complex setup or configuration
- ✅ Works on Windows, Mac, Linux
- ✅ Zero external dependencies beyond Python
 
---
 
### Step 2: Configure MCP Server (90 seconds)
 
**Narration**:
> "Now let's configure the MCP server in Claude Desktop. We'll add Code Scalpel to the MCP servers configuration."
 
**File**: `~/.claude_desktop_config.json` (Mac/Linux) or `%APPDATA%/Claude/claude_desktop_config.json` (Windows)
 
**Configuration**:
```json
{
  "mcpServers": {
    "code-scalpel": {
      "command": "python",
      "args": ["-m", "code_scalpel.mcp"],
      "env": {
        "SCALPEL_ROOT": "/path/to/your/project"
      }
    }
  }
}
```
 
**Talking Points**:
- ✅ Standard MCP server configuration
- ✅ `SCALPEL_ROOT` points to your codebase
- ✅ Works with any MCP-compatible client (Claude Desktop, VS Code, Cursor)
 
**Demo Tip**:
> Replace `/path/to/your/project` with the actual path to the demo codebase (e.g., the `vulnerable_webapp` folder in this demos directory).
 
---
 
### Step 3: Restart Claude Desktop (10 seconds)
 
**Narration**:
> "Restart Claude Desktop to load the new MCP server."
 
**Action**:
1. Quit Claude Desktop completely
2. Reopen Claude Desktop
3. Look for the 🔌 MCP icon in the interface
 
**Verification**:
- You should see "code-scalpel" listed in available MCP servers
- Status should show as "connected"
 
---
 
### Step 4: First Tool Call - Extract Code (2 minutes)
 
**Narration**:
> "Let's make our first tool call. We'll use the `extract_code` tool to surgically extract a single function from a large file."
 
**Setup**: Create a sample Python file with multiple functions:
 
**File**: `demo_app.py`
```python
# This file is 500 lines long (simulated)
# ... lots of code ...
 
def calculate_tax(amount: float, state: str) -> float:
    """Calculate sales tax based on state."""
    tax_rates = {
        "CA": 0.0725,
        "NY": 0.04,
        "TX": 0.0625,
        "FL": 0.06,
    }
    rate = tax_rates.get(state, 0.0)
    return amount * rate
 
def process_payment(amount: float, method: str) -> dict:
    """Process payment with given method."""
    # ... implementation ...
    pass
 
# ... many more functions ...
```
 
**Prompt to Claude**:
```
Extract the calculate_tax function from demo_app.py
```
 
**What Claude Does** (visible to user):
```
Using tool: extract_code
├─ file_path: demo_app.py
├─ symbol_name: calculate_tax
├─ symbol_type: function
└─ include_context: true
```
 
**Expected Output**:
```python
def calculate_tax(amount: float, state: str) -> float:
    """Calculate sales tax based on state."""
    tax_rates = {
        "CA": 0.0725,
        "NY": 0.04,
        "TX": 0.0625,
        "FL": 0.06,
    }
    rate = tax_rates.get(state, 0.0)
    return amount * rate
```

### Step 5: The "Aha Moment" - Token Efficiency (90 seconds)
 
**Narration**:
> "Here's the magic. Instead of sending the entire 500-line file to the AI (which would cost ~10,000 tokens), Code Scalpel extracted just the function we needed - only ~50 tokens. That's a 200x reduction in token usage."
 
**Visual Comparison** (show on screen):
 
```
WITHOUT Code Scalpel:
📄 Full file: 500 lines → ~10,000 tokens
💰 Cost: $0.15 per request (at $15/million tokens)
⏱️ Latency: 2-3 seconds to process
 
WITH Code Scalpel:
🎯 Extracted function: 10 lines → ~50 tokens
💰 Cost: $0.0075 per request
⏱️ Latency: 0.1 seconds to extract + process
```
 
**Key Talking Points**:
- ✅ **200x token reduction** for large files
- ✅ **20x cost savings** on AI API calls
- ✅ **Faster responses** - less data to process
- ✅ **Better context** - AI sees only what it needs

### Step 6: Try Another Tool - Analyze Code (60 seconds)
 
**Narration**:
> "Let's try another tool. We'll analyze the entire file to get its structure without executing any code."
 
**Prompt to Claude**:
```
Analyze the structure of demo_app.py
```
 
**Expected Output**:
```json
{
  "file_path": "demo_app.py",
  "language": "python",
  "functions": [
    {"name": "calculate_tax", "line_start": 4, "complexity": 2},
    {"name": "process_payment", "line_start": 15, "complexity": 5}
  ],
  "classes": [],
  "imports": [],
  "total_lines": 500,
  "avg_complexity": 3.5
}
```
 
**Talking Points**:
- ✅ Parse code structure without execution (safe for untrusted code)
- ✅ Get complexity metrics instantly
- ✅ Perfect for code review and understanding

## 🎤 Presentation Tips
 
### For Live Demos:
1. **Pre-install** Code Scalpel to save time
2. **Have config ready** in a text file to paste
3. **Use large demo file** (500+ lines) to show token savings
4. **Show the MCP icon** in Claude Desktop for visual proof
 
### For Recorded Videos:
1. **Screen recording**: Show full installation process
2. **Zoom in** on configuration file for clarity
3. **Use screen annotations** to highlight token savings
4. **Picture-in-picture**: Show your face explaining while demo runs
 
### For Conference Talks:
1. **Start with problem**: "AI code tools read entire files - wasteful"
2. **Show installation**: "One command to solve this"
3. **Live demo**: Extract code in real-time
4. **Reveal savings**: Show token/cost comparison
