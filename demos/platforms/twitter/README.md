# Twitter/X Demo Strategy for Code Scalpel
 
**How to create viral threads and engagement on Twitter/X**
 
---
 
## 🎯 Twitter Strategy
 
### Core Principles
1. **Hook in first tweet** - Grab attention immediately
2. **Visual content** - Screenshots, GIFs, videos
3. **Short and punchy** - Get to the point fast
4. **Thread format** - 5-10 tweets for tutorials
5. **Engage actively** - Reply to every mention

## 📝 Thread Templates
 
### Template 1: Problem-Solution Thread
 
```
Tweet 1/7 (Hook):
I was spending $450/month on Claude API calls.
 
Most of those tokens were wasted on irrelevant code.
 
Here's how I reduced costs by 200x with one tool: 🧵
 
Tweet 2/7 (Problem):
The problem with AI code assistants:
 
They need to see entire files to answer simple questions.
 
"Explain this function" → Sends 500 lines
Cost: 10,000 tokens (~$0.15 per query)
 
Tweet 3/7 (Visual):
[Screenshot: Before/After comparison]
 
BEFORE Code Scalpel:
📄 500 lines → 10,000 tokens → $0.15
 
AFTER Code Scalpel:
🎯 10 lines → 50 tokens → $0.0075
 
200x reduction ↓
 
Tweet 4/7 (Solution):
Code Scalpel is an MCP server that surgically extracts code.
 
Instead of sending entire files, it extracts just what you need:
• Functions
• Classes
• Methods
• Dependencies
 
Works with Python, JS, TS, Java 🔥
 
Tweet 5/7 (Demo):
[GIF: Showing extraction in action]
 
Ask: "Explain calculate_tax"
Gets: Just that function (50 tokens)
 
Response is:
✅ 20x cheaper
✅ 4x faster
✅ More accurate (less confusion)
 
Tweet 6/7 (Bonus):
Beyond extraction, includes 18 more tools:
 
• Security scanning (OWASP Top 10)
• Call graph visualization
• Auto-generate unit tests
• Project architecture mapping
• Safe refactoring
 
All free 👇
 
Tweet 7/7 (CTA):
Install in 2 minutes:
 
```bash
pip install code-scalpel
```
 
Free tier includes everything.

Saved me $400/month 💰
 
Retweet if you found this useful!

### Template 2: Security Focus Thread
 
```
Tweet 1/6:
Found 50 security vulnerabilities in my codebase in 30 seconds.
 
Using an MCP server I built for Claude.
 
Here's what it caught (and how you can use it): 🧵
 
Tweet 2/6:
The tool: Code Scalpel
 
Scans for OWASP Top 10:
• SQL injection
• XSS
• Command injection
• Path traversal
• Hardcoded secrets
 
Real-time as you code, not in CI/CD ⚡
 
Tweet 3/6:
Example: SQL Injection detected
 
[Screenshot of vulnerability finding]
 
Code Scalpel found:
❌ f-string SQL query
🎯 Line 34
✅ Fix provided: Use parameterized queries
 
Instant feedback 🔥
 
Tweet 4/6:
Why it's different:
 
Most tools run AFTER you commit.
 
Code Scalpel integrates with your AI assistant.
Scan while you write code.
 
Catch bugs before they reach production 🛡️
 
Tweet 5/6:
Works with:
• Claude Desktop
• VS Code + MCP
• Cursor
• Any MCP client
 
Languages:
• Python
• JavaScript/TypeScript
• Java
• JSX/TSX
 
Tweet 6/6:
Try it (free):
 
```bash
pip install code-scalpel
```
 
Saved my team from 3 critical bugs this week.

### Template 3: "Show Your Work" Thread
 
```
Tweet 1/8:
I built an AI tool that:
 
✅ Reduced token usage 200x
✅ Found 50 bugs in 30 seconds
✅ Cut API costs from $450 to $22/month
 
All open source.
 
Here's the breakdown: 🧵
 
Tweet 2/8:
The Problem:
 
AI assistants are amazing but inefficient.
 
They read entire files when you only need one function.
 
This wastes:
• Tokens ($$$)
• Time
• Context window
• Accuracy
 
Tweet 3/8:
My solution: Surgical code extraction
 
Instead of:
"Here's my 500-line file, Claude"
 
Do this:
"Here's the exact function you need"
 
50 tokens vs 10,000 tokens

Tweet 4/8:
Built as an MCP server:
 
• 19 tools for code analysis
• AST-based (no code execution)
• Multi-language support
• Free forever tier
 
Took 3 weeks to build
Now saves 20+ hours/month ⏰
 
Tweet 5/8:
Real results from my codebase:
 
Before:
• 100 queries/day
• $450/month API costs
• Lots of AI confusion
 
After:
• Same 100 queries
• $22/month
• More accurate responses
 
Tweet 6/8:
Unexpected wins:
 
Beyond token savings, it also:
 
1. Security scanning (found critical bugs)
2. Auto-generate tests (saved hours)
3. Call graphs (understand legacy code)
4. Safe refactoring (with backups)
 
Never planned these, but they're 🔥
 
Tweet 7/8:
Tech stack:
 
• FastMCP for protocol
• Tree-sitter for parsing
• Z3 for symbolic execution
• Pydantic for validation
 
Python 3.10+
MIT licensed
100% local (code never leaves your machine)
 
Tweet 8/8:
Try it:
 
```bash
pip install code-scalpel
```

3. **Share in DMs** to engaged followers
4. **Post at peak times** - 9am-12pm EST, Mon-Thu
 
### After Publishing
 
1. **Reply to yourself** with additional context
2. **Quote tweet** to add commentary
3. **Respond to every reply** within first 2 hours
4. **Retweet praise** (sparingly)
5. **Create poll** for engagement
 
### Hashtags (Use 2-3 max)
 
- #AI
- #MachineLearning
- #DevTools

## 📱 Mobile Optimization
 
- Keep tweets under 280 chars (mobile truncates)
