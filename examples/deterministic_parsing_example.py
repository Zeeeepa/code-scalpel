"""
Reference implementation: Refactoring PDG Builder to use deterministic parsing.

BEFORE (non-deterministic):
```python
def build(self, code: str) -> tuple[nx.DiGraph, nx.DiGraph]:
    tree = ast.parse(code)  # ❌ NO ERROR HANDLING
    self.visit(tree)
    return self.graph, self.call_graph
```

AFTER (deterministic):
```python
from code_scalpel.parsing import parse_python_code, ParsingError

def build(self, code: str) -> tuple[nx.DiGraph, nx.DiGraph]:
    try:
        tree, report = parse_python_code(code)
    except ParsingError as e:
        # Deterministic error - same input always produces same error
        raise ValueError(
            f"Cannot build PDG: {e}\\n"
            f"Location: {e.location}\\n"
            f"Suggestion: {e.suggestion}"
        ) from e

    # Track if code was modified
    if report.was_sanitized:
        self._sanitization_report = report

    self.visit(tree)
    return self.graph, self.call_graph
```

Benefits:
1. ✅ Deterministic: Same code + same config = same result
2. ✅ Controlled by response_config.json (no code changes needed)
3. ✅ Consistent error messages across all entry points
4. ✅ Sanitization tracking available to caller
