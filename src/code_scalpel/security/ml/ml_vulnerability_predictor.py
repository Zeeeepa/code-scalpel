"""
ML-Based Vulnerability Predictor - Learn from Historical Bugs.

[FUTURE_FEATURE] v3.4.0 - Machine learning for bug prediction

Train ML models on historical vulnerability data to:
- Predict which code paths are most likely buggy
- Prioritize security analysis on high-risk code
- Suggest similar past vulnerabilities
- Auto-classify vulnerability severity

Example:
    >>> from code_scalpel.security.ml.ml_vulnerability_predictor import VulnerabilityPredictor
    >>> predictor = VulnerabilityPredictor()
    >>> predictor.train(historical_vulnerabilities)
    >>> risk_score = predictor.predict(code_snippet)
    >>> if risk_score > 0.8:
    ...     print("High risk - prioritize security analysis")
