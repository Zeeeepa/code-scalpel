- osv_client.py: OSV API client (moved from ast_tools/ in Phase 4)

Pro Tier Features:
- vulnerability_reachability.py: Reachability analysis for vulnerabilities
- false_positive_reducer.py: False positive reduction
- severity_contextualizer.py: Context-aware severity assessment

Enterprise Tier Features:
