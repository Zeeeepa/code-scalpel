"""
[20251217_FEATURE] Autonomy module - v3.0.0 autonomous code repair features.

This module provides supervised autonomous code repair capabilities with
safety guarantees:

1. Error-to-Diff Engine: Converts error messages to actionable fix hints
   with confidence scoring and human review flagging.

2. Fix Loop Termination: Prevents infinite retry loops with hard limits,
   timeouts, and repeated error detection.

3. Mutation Test Gate: Prevents "hollow fixes" where tests pass because
   functionality was deleted, not because the bug was fixed.

4. Audit Trail: Cryptographically-hashed immutable audit log of all
   autonomous operations for compliance and debugging.

5. Framework Integrations: LangGraph state machines, CrewAI tools,
   and AutoGen function schemas for multi-agent workflows.

6. Sandboxed Execution: Speculative execution in isolated temp directories
   with automatic cleanup, resource limits, and side effect detection.

Features:
- Multi-language error parsing (Python, TypeScript, Java)
- Confidence-scored fix generation
- Bounded fix attempts with timeout
- Repeated error detection
- Human escalation on failure
- Full audit trail with SHA-256 hashing
- Hollow fix detection via mutation testing
- Speculative execution in isolated sandbox
- LangGraph, CrewAI, AutoGen integrations

Usage:
    from code_scalpel.autonomy import (
        ErrorToDiffEngine,
        ErrorAnalysis,
        FixLoop,
        MutationTestGate,
        AutonomyAuditTrail,
        SandboxExecutor,
    )
