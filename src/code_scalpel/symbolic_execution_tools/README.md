# Symbolic Execution Tools Module

**Purpose:** Symbolic execution engine and security analysis

## Overview

This module provides symbolic execution capabilities for analyzing program behavior and detecting security vulnerabilities through taint analysis.

## Core Components

### engine.py (19,651 LOC)
**Symbolic execution engine**

```python
class SymbolicExecutionEngine:
    def execute(self, code: str, max_paths: int = 10) -> SymbolicResult:
        """Symbolically execute code to explore all paths."""
        pass
```

**Features:**
- Z3 constraint solver integration
- Path explosion mitigation (bounded unrolling)
- State forking and merging
- Type support: Int, Bool, String, Float
- Loop unrolling with fuel limits

### security_analyzer.py (36,022 LOC)
**Security vulnerability detection**

```python
class SecurityAnalyzer:
    def analyze(self, code: str) -> SecurityResult:
        """Detect security vulnerabilities via taint analysis."""
        pass
```

**Detects (OWASP Top 10):**
- SQL Injection (CWE-89)
- NoSQL Injection (CWE-943)
- Cross-Site Scripting (CWE-79)
- Command Injection (CWE-78)
- Path Traversal (CWE-22)
- LDAP Injection (CWE-90)
- XXE - XML External Entity (CWE-611)
- SSTI - Server-Side Template Injection (CWE-1336)

### taint_tracker.py (104,118 LOC) - **LARGEST MODULE**
**Data flow and taint tracking**

```python
class TaintTracker:
    def track_taint(self, source: Node, sink: Node) -> List[TaintPath]:
        """Track taint propagation from source to sink."""
        pass
```

**Taint Levels:**
- `UNTAINTED` - Safe data
- `LOW` - User input from authenticated users
- `MEDIUM` - External API data
- `HIGH` - Direct user input
- `CRITICAL` - Unauthenticated external input

**Key Features:**
- Interprocedural taint tracking
- Taint propagation rules
- Sanitizer detection
- Source-sink analysis

### vulnerability_scanner.py (23,106 LOC)
**Pattern-based vulnerability scanning**

Complements taint analysis with pattern matching:
- Hardcoded credentials detection
- Weak cryptography detection (MD5, SHA-1)
- Dangerous function usage (`eval`, `exec`, `pickle.load`)
- SQL injection patterns

## Advanced Components

### cross_file_taint.py (49,520 LOC)
**Cross-file taint tracking**

Tracks taint flow across module boundaries:
```python
# routes.py
user_input = request.json['data']  # Source
process_data(user_input)

# utils.py
def process_data(data):
    cursor.execute(f"SELECT * FROM users WHERE id = {data}")  # Sink
```

### unified_sink_detector.py (40,109 LOC)
**Polyglot sink detection**

Unified sink detection across languages:
- Python: `execute()`, `eval()`, `os.system()`
- Java: `executeQuery()`, `Runtime.exec()`
- JavaScript: `eval()`, `innerHTML =`
- TypeScript: Same as JavaScript

### type_evaporation_detector.py (24,503 LOC)
**TypeScript type evaporation detection**

Detects when TypeScript compile-time types evaporate at runtime:
```typescript
type Role = 'admin' | 'user'
const role = input.value as Role  // ❌ Type assertion without validation
```

## Security-Focused Components

**Hardcoded secret detection**

Detects 30+ patterns:
- API keys
- Passwords
- Private keys

### schema_drift_detector.py (33,169 LOC)
**Database schema drift detection**

Detects when code assumptions don't match database schema:
```python
# Code expects: users.email (string)
# Database has: users.email_address (string)
```

## Specialized Analysis

### ir_interpreter.py (42,392 LOC)
**IR-based symbolic execution**

Executes unified IR symbolically (language-agnostic):
```python
class IRInterpreter:
    def interpret(self, ir: IRNode) -> SymbolicState:
        """Interpret IR symbolically."""
        pass
```

### state_manager.py (10,460 LOC)
**Symbolic state management**

Manages symbolic execution state:
- Variable bindings
- Constraints
- Path conditions
- State forking/merging

### constraint_solver.py (11,867 LOC)
**Z3 constraint solver wrapper**

Wraps Z3 for constraint solving:
```python
class ConstraintSolver:
    def solve(self, constraints: List[Constraint]) -> Solution:
        """Solve constraints using Z3."""
        pass
```

### type_inference.py (12,243 LOC)
**Symbolic type inference**

Infers types during symbolic execution:
```python
x = "hello"  # x: string
y = len(x)   # y: int
```

## Usage

```python
from code_scalpel.symbolic_execution_tools import (
    SymbolicExecutionEngine,
    SecurityAnalyzer,
    TaintTracker
)

# Symbolic execution
engine = SymbolicExecutionEngine()
result = engine.execute(code, max_paths=10)
for path in result.paths:
    print(f"Path {path.path_id}: {path.reproduction_input}")

# Security analysis
analyzer = SecurityAnalyzer()
security_result = analyzer.analyze(code)
if security_result.has_vulnerabilities:
    for vuln in security_result.vulnerabilities:
        print(f"{vuln.type} at line {vuln.line}: {vuln.description}")

# Taint tracking
tracker = TaintTracker()
taint_flows = tracker.track_taint(source_node, sink_node)
for flow in taint_flows:
    print(f"Taint path: {' -> '.join(flow.nodes)}")
```

## Integration

Used by:
- `mcp/server.py` - MCP tools: `security_scan`, `symbolic_execute`, `cross_file_security_scan`
- `generators/` - Test generation from symbolic paths
