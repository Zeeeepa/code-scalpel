Concolic Execution Engine - Hybrid Concrete and Symbolic Execution.

[FUTURE_FEATURE] v3.3.0 - Concolic execution for better path coverage

Concolic (CONCrete + symbOLIC) execution combines:
- Concrete execution: Run code with actual values
- Symbolic execution: Track constraints on paths taken

Benefits:
- Faster than pure symbolic (no path explosion for simple code)
- More coverage than pure concrete (explores alternative paths)
- Handles complex operations (hash functions, crypto) via concrete values

Example:
    >>> from code_scalpel.symbolic_execution_tools import ConcolicEngine
    >>> engine = ConcolicEngine()
    >>> result = engine.execute(code, initial_inputs={"x": 5})
    >>> # Explores paths using concrete values as guidance
