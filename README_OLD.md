# Code Scalpel: Surgical Code Operations for AI Agents

**Coming January 2026 | v1.0 Public Release Preview**

Code Scalpel is the bridge between **Generative AI** and **Reliable Software Engineering**.

It is an **MCP (Model Context Protocol) server** designed to be the primary toolset for AI agents (like Claude, GitHub Copilot, and Cursor) to perceive, analyze, and modify codebases with surgical precision.

## Quick Start (3 Steps)

**New to Code Scalpel?** Start here:

1. **[📖 Beginner's Guide](docs/getting_started/getting_started.md)** — No software experience needed. Plain English explanation of what Code Scalpel is and how to use it.
2. **[✅ Setup Checklist](docs/SETUP_CHECKLIST.md)** — Step-by-step checklist to get up and running in 5 minutes.
3. **Start asking your AI assistant** — Ask Claude, Copilot, or Cursor to help you with your code.

## The Problem: Why Agents Struggle with Code
Today's AI agents treat code as **text**. They read file contents, guess line numbers, and generate diffs. This leads to:
*   **Hallucination**: "Replace line 50" fails when the file changed.
*   **Context Window Exhaustion**: Reading 10 files to find one definition.
*   **Security Blindness**: Generating SQL injection vulnerabilities because they lack taint analysis.
*   **Regression**: Making changes that break existing behavior without verification.

## The Solution: Tools, Not Text
Code Scalpel treats code as a **Graph** (AST + PDG). It gives agents deterministic tools to interact with the codebase:
*   **Don't read the file** → `extract_function("process_payment")`
*   **Don't guess the line** → `update_symbol("process_payment", new_code)`
*   **Don't guess dependencies** → `get_cross_file_dependencies("Order")`
*   **Don't assume safety** → `security_scan(code)`

## Key Capabilities at Launch (v1.0) | Jan 2026

Code Scalpel launches with **22 specialized tools** divided into five surgical disciplines. All tools are available in the open-source Community Edition.

### 1. Surgical Extraction & Analysis (6 Tools)
Stop grepping. Start understanding.
*   **`extract_code`**: Surgically extract functions/classes by name, including necessary imports.
*   **`analyze_code`**: Parse structure, complexity, imports, and definitions.
*   **`get_project_map`**: Instant high-level cognitive map of the project structure.
*   **`get_call_graph`**: Trace execution flow and relationships across files.
*   **`get_symbol_references`**: Find all usages of a symbol across the project.
*   **`get_file_context`**: Get surrounding context and metadata for any code location.

### 2. Taint-Based Security (6 Tools)
Real security analysis, not just regex matching.
*   **`security_scan`**: Trace data flow from user input to dangerous sinks (12+ CWEs).
*   **`unified_sink_detect`**: Polyglot detection of dangerous functions (sinks).
*   **`cross_file_security_scan`**: Track dirty data even when it passes through multiple modules.
*   **`scan_dependencies`**: Check package dependencies for known vulnerabilities (CVEs).
*   **`type_evaporation_scan`**: Detect TypeScript type system vulnerabilities at I/O boundaries.
*   **`get_graph_neighborhood`**: Extract k-hop security context around specific nodes.

### 3. Safe Modification (4 Tools)
*   **`update_symbol`**: Atomic replacement of code blocks with safety checks.
*   **`rename_symbol`**: Project-wide refactoring that updates all references consistently.
*   **`simulate_refactor`**: "Dry run" tool that verifies changes before application (safety/build).
*   **`validate_paths`**: Pre-flight path validation for file operations (Docker-aware).

### 4. Verification & Testing (4 Tools)
Trust, but verify.
*   **`symbolic_execute`**: Uses the Z3 theorem prover to mentally explore code paths.
*   **`generate_unit_tests`**: Auto-creates mathematical proof-of-correctness tests from execution paths.
*   **`crawl_project`**: Project-wide analysis of code structure and metrics.
*   **`verify_policy_integrity`**: Cryptographically verify policy files haven't been tampered with.

### 5. Advanced Analysis (2 Tools)
*   **`get_cross_file_dependencies`**: Analyze complex dependency chains across files.
*   **`code_policy_check`**: Evaluate code against organizational compliance standards.

## How We're Different

### Code Scalpel vs Python `scalpel` Library

Code Scalpel is NOT a fork or wrapper of the `scalpel` Python library. It's a completely independent, production-grade MCP server:

| **AI Agent Ready** | Yes (designed for agents) | CLI-only |
| **Tools** | 22 specialized tools | Limited utilities |
| **Security Scanning** | Taint analysis (12 CWEs) | Basic pattern matching |
| **Symbolic Execution** | Z3-powered (all paths) | Not supported |
| **Test Generation** | Auto-generate from paths | Not supported |
| **Refactor Verification** | Behavior preservation check | Manual verification |
| **Cross-file Analysis** | Full dependency tracking | Limited scope |
| **Licensing** | Community (MIT) + Pro/Enterprise | N/A |
