# [20260108_TEST] Concurrency tests for rename_symbol with parallel operations
"""Concurrency validation for rename_symbol.

Tests verify:
- Parallel renames to same symbol (atomic writes)
- Parallel renames to different symbols (isolation)
- Backup file integrity under concurrent operations
- Lock semantics and race condition handling
