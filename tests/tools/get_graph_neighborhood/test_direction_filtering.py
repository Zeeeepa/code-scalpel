"""
Direction filtering tests for get_graph_neighborhood.

Tests the direction parameter:
- direction="outgoing" - only follow calls FROM center outward
- direction="incoming" - only follow calls TO center inward
- direction="both" - follow in both directions (default)

These tests validate filtering logic (CRITICAL for pre-release).
