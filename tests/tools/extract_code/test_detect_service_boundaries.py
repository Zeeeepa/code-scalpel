"""[20260103_TEST] Comprehensive tests for detect_service_boundaries() Enterprise feature.

Tests validate service boundary detection and microservice split suggestions:
- Dependency graph analysis
- Isolation score calculation
- Service boundary clustering
- Isolation level classification
- Large project handling
- Edge cases and error handling
