"""Polyglot language support verification tests.

Validates that each tool's language support matches documentation:
- Python: Full support for most tools
- JavaScript/TypeScript: Sink detection and basic analysis
- Java: Limited support (sink detection)
- C/C++/C#: Extraction support (analyze_code, extract_code) — added v2.0.0
- Go: Extraction support (analyze_code, extract_code) — added v2.0.3 [20260302_FEATURE]
- Ruby: Full Phase 1+2 support — added v2.1.x [20260304_FEATURE]
- Rust/PHP: Roadmap/partial support

Tests verify:
- Claimed language support actually works
- Graceful handling of unsupported languages
- Accuracy across supported languages

[20260124_TEST] Created comprehensive polyglot language verification.
[20260224_TEST] Updated for v2.0.0: C, C++, C# are now fully supported.
[20260302_TEST] Updated for v2.0.3: Go is now fully supported.
[20260304_TEST] Updated for v2.1.x: Ruby is now fully supported.
