## Key Messages (Core Messaging)

Use these in ALL communications this week:

### Primary Message
**"Code Scalpel is the verification layer for AI-assisted development—mathematically prove your code is safe before you apply it."**

### Problem Statement
"GitHub Copilot and similar tools are powerful but unreliable. They hallucinate. They miss security issues. They create technical debt. Code Scalpel solves this by mathematically verifying every suggestion before you apply it."

### Value Proposition
- ✅ **Safety:** Deterministic verification (not probabilistic guessing)
- ✅ **Speed:** 99% token reduction vs traditional LLM context
- ✅ **Governance:** Immutable audit trails for enterprises
- ✅ **Compatibility:** Works with any LLM (Copilot, Claude, local models)

### Call-to-Action
"Try Code Scalpel free. Join 100+ beta testers. Help shape the future of trustworthy AI coding."
