## 🆘 If You Get Stuck

### Analytics Setup Issues
→ See [ANALYTICS_SETUP.md](ANALYTICS_SETUP.md) "Support References" section

### Blog Writing Blocked
→ Copy template verbatim, customize examples for your company
→ Template already includes structure, just fill in blanks

### Video Production Struggling
→ Hire video editor on Fiverr/Upwork ($100-300)
→ Or skip video for Week 1, do in Week 2

### Email Outreach Anxiety
→ Use [BETA_PROGRAM_INVITATION.md](BETA_PROGRAM_INVITATION.md) templates exactly
→ Personalization takes 30 seconds per email
→ Most people appreciate personal outreach

### ProductHunt Launch Worrying
→ [PRODUCTHUNT_LAUNCH.md](PRODUCTHUNT_LAUNCH.md) has detailed timeline
→ Follow it step-by-step
→ Timing and engagement are key (not perfection)
