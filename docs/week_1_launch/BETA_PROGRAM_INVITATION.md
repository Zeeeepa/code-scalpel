## Email Template #1: Tier 1 (Warmest Contacts)

**Subject Line:** `Quick favor: Beta testing a dev tool I built`

```
Hi [NAME],

I'm reaching out because I respect your work in software development, and I'd love your feedback on something I've been building.

I've created Code Scalpel—a verification layer for AI-generated code (Copilot, Claude, etc.). Here's the problem it solves:

GitHub Copilot is amazing for productivity, but it can't catch security issues, type errors, or logic bugs. You might deploy code that looks right but has a hidden SQL injection vulnerability. An LLM can't verify this.

Code Scalpel fixes it. It analyzes code mathematically (using AST parsing, data flow analysis, and symbolic execution) to catch issues instantly. Think of it as the safety verification you need when using AI code assistants.

**Why I'm reaching out to you:**
You understand both developer productivity AND code quality. I need people like you to try Code Scalpel and tell me honestly:
- Does it solve a real problem?
- Is the UX intuitive?
- What's missing?
- Would you pay for this?

**What I'm asking:**
- Try Code Scalpel free for 1-2 weeks
- Give me feedback (30 min conversation, or Slack comments)
- That's it. No commitment.

**What you get:**
- Early access (ahead of public launch)
- Lifetime discount on the paid tier (if you want it)
- Direct influence on the roadmap
- Your name in the "Beta Testers" section (if interested)

**Next steps:**
1. Click here to sign up for beta: [link to beta signup form]
2. I'll send you the setup instructions
3. Try it out, and let me know what you think

If you have any questions, just reply to this email.

I'd really appreciate your help. [NAME], your feedback would be invaluable.

Thanks,
Tim

P.S. If this isn't relevant to you, no worries—feel free to forward to someone you think would be interested. Happy to pay it forward if you know someone who'd be a good fit.
```

## Email Template #2: Tier 2 (Warm Network)

**Subject Line:** `Beta testing: AI code verification tool`

```
Hi there,

I've been following your work on [specific topic], and I think you might be interested in something I've built.

Code Scalpel is a verification layer for AI-generated code. It catches security vulnerabilities, type errors, and logic bugs that GitHub Copilot misses.

**The problem:** GitHub Copilot generates code fast, but can't verify if it's safe.

**The solution:** Code Scalpel analyzes code mathematically to find issues instantly.

**I'm looking for beta testers** who use AI coding assistants (Copilot, Claude, etc.) and care about code quality. If that's you, I'd love your feedback.

**Get early access:**
- Try free for 2 weeks
- No credit card needed
- Give feedback, influence the roadmap
- Special pricing when we launch

[Link to beta signup]

If you have questions, reply to this email. If not, no pressure—I know everyone's busy.

Thanks for considering!

Tim

## Email Template #3: Tier 3 (Community Broadcast)

**Subject Line:** `Verify AI-generated code safely (2-min setup)`

```
Hi developer friends,

I've built something that solves a problem I've been frustrated with: GitHub Copilot is amazing for productivity, but it can't verify code safety.

Meet Code Scalpel.

It analyzes code mathematically to catch:
- Security vulnerabilities (SQL injection, XSS, command injection)
- Type errors
- Logic bugs
- Missing error handling

**2-minute demo:** [YouTube link]

**Try free:** [Beta signup link]

**Why now?** AI coding is taking off, but safety verification is still manual. Code Scalpel automates this.

If you use Copilot or Claude and care about code quality, you'd probably find this useful.

No pressure, but if you want to try it and give feedback, I'd appreciate it.

Thanks,
Tim
```
