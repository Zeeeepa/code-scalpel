3. **ProductHunt Engagement** - First 24 hours matter. Be active and responsive.

4. **Email Personalization** - Cold outreach: ~30% response. Personal outreach: ~50-80%.

- 2 minutes is perfect (longer = fewer views)

**Beta Outreach**

- Tier 2 (warm network): 20-30, ~40% response
- Tier 3 (community): 50-100, ~5-10% response
- Follow up after 3-5 days if no response

**ProductHunt**
- Post Friday at 7 AM PT (peak time)
- Be responsive (reply within 30 min)
- Engage with other products too
- Don't oversell, be authentic

**Metrics**
- Update daily at same time (e.g., 6 PM)
- Compare to target (not perfection)
- Celebrate wins publicly
- Document what drove each spike

## 🚨 POTENTIAL BLOCKERS (& Solutions)

| Blocker | Solution |
|---------|----------|
| No time for analytics | Use Google Sheets template only (skip GitHub Actions) |
| Can't write 3 blog posts | Use templates verbatim, customize examples only |
| No video production skills | Hire editor on Fiverr ($100-300) or skip video |
| Email outreach anxiety | Use templates exactly, personalize takes 30s per email |
| ProductHunt jitters | Follow timeline exactly, success comes from engagement not perfection |

## 📞 IF YOU GET STUCK

**Problem:** Don't know what to do next  
**Solution:** Check `WEEK_1_OVERVIEW.md` for your day, follow exactly

**Problem:** Blog post feels stuck  
**Solution:** Use template verbatim, just customize company/links

**Problem:** ProductHunt feels overwhelming  
**Solution:** Check `PRODUCTHUNT_LAUNCH.md` timeline, follow hour-by-hour

**Problem:** Not hitting metrics  
**Solution:** Document what happened, adjust Week 2, keep going
