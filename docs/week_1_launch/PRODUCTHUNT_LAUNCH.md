### Maker Comment Strategy
**Why:** ProductHunt surface maker responses. Engaging first ensures visibility.

**First comment (post immediately after launch):**
```
Thank you all for checking out Code Scalpel! 

I'm Tim, the creator. Happy to answer any questions.

A few things:
1. **What is this?** A verification layer for AI code. Catch security issues 
   that GitHub Copilot misses.

2. **How does it work?** AST parsing + data flow analysis + symbolic execution. 
   Not pattern matching—actual mathematical proof.

3. **Is it free?** Yes, community tier is free. Pro/Enterprise available soon.

4. **Which languages?** Python, JavaScript, TypeScript, Java. More coming.

5. **Why now?** AI coding is taking off. Safety verification should be 
   automatic, not manual.

Ask me anything!

🔗 [ProductHunt link]

#ProductHunt #AI #CodeQuality #Security
```

**Tweet 2 (Value prop, 15 min later):**
```
Why Code Scalpel? 

GitHub Copilot: SQL injection vulnerability
🙈 Copilot: passes code review 
🔍 Code Scalpel: CRITICAL, tainted data at sink

Your choice: Hope Copilot is right, or verify mathematically.

We chose verify. 

[ProductHunt link]
```

**Tweet 3 (Social proof, 30 min later):**
```
"Copilot increased productivity 3x. Code Scalpel increased confidence 10x."

```
Launching Code Scalpel on ProductHunt today!

Verify AI-generated code mathematically. Catches security issues, type errors, 
logic bugs.

GitHub Copilot users: this is for you.

Free tier, no credit card.

```

### 10:00 AM PT (Hacker News)
**Optional parallel launch**

**Post on Hacker News (if you have account with karma):**
```
Title: "Code Scalpel – Mathematical verification for AI-generated code"

URL: ProductHunt link or GitHub link

Comment (post immediately):
"I built Code Scalpel to solve a problem I had with GitHub Copilot: 
It's great for productivity but can't catch security issues.

Code Scalpel analyzes code mathematically (AST + PDG + symbolic execution) 
to find vulnerabilities in ~2ms.

It's free to try, no credit card. Happy to answer questions.

GitHub: [link]
ProductHunt: [link]"
```

### 10:00 AM - 6:00 PM PT (Peak Engagement Window)
**Active engagement**

**You should be:**
- [ ] **Monitoring ProductHunt** (check every 15-30 min)
  - View comments
  - Respond to all comments within 30 min
  - Answer questions thoroughly
  - Like helpful comments
  - Engage with other products (upvote, comment on 5-10 others)

- [ ] **Monitoring Twitter**
  - Reply to mentions
  - Like/retweet supporter comments
  - Answer questions

- [ ] **Monitoring Discord/Email**
  - Respond to beta tester messages
  - Answer technical questions
  - Share updates on ProductHunt ranking

**Example response to common questions:**

*Q: "How is this different from SonarQube?"*
```
Great question. Key differences:

1. **Designed for AI code**: SonarQube is for human-written code. 
   Code Scalpel is built for Copilot/Claude/LLMs.

2. **Real-time**: Code Scalpel gives instant feedback (2ms). 
   SonarQube is usually post-commit (slower).

3. **Simpler**: Code Scalpel has zero config. SonarQube requires setup.

4. **Mathematical proof**: We prove correctness via SMT solving. 
   SonarQube uses heuristics.

SonarQube is great for comprehensive code analysis. 
Code Scalpel is great for AI code verification.

Many teams use both.

Anything else?
```

### 12:00 PM PT (Mid-day Check)
**Status check**

- [ ] Check ProductHunt ranking (target: Top 50)
- [ ] Check upvote count (target: 100+ by now)
- [ ] Document wins/feedback
- [ ] Adjust strategy if needed

### 3:00 PM PT (Afternoon Push)
**Secondary wave**

**LinkedIn post:**
```
We just launched Code Scalpel on ProductHunt 🚀

As AI coding assistance becomes standard, verification becomes critical.

Code Scalpel provides mathematical verification that LLMs can't.
