## 💡 Key Insights

1. **Everything is templated** - You don't write from scratch. All templates are complete. Just personalize and publish.

2. **Timing is staggered** - Each day focuses on one major activity (analytics Monday, blogs Tue-Wed, community Thu, launch Fri)

3. **Success is measurable** - All metrics are trackable and specific. You'll know exactly how you're doing daily.

4. **Contingencies included** - Every document has "if X goes wrong, do Y" plans

5. **Designed for one person** - Tim can execute everything solo, with optional contractor help for video/editing

6. **Documentation is thorough** - Each document explains the "why" plus the "how"

## ❓ Questions?

**"Do I need to follow this exactly?"**
No. Use it as a starting point. Adjust based on your situation and resources.

**"What if I can't do all of it?"**
Prioritize: Analytics (Mon) → Blog (Tue-Wed) → ProductHunt (Fri). Video is nice-to-have.

**"What if Week 1 doesn't hit targets?"**
You still have momentum. Week 2 can make up ground. Keep executing.

**"How much will this cost?"**
Free (analytics tools, Discord, email). Optional: video editor ($100-300).

**"Who should I tell about this?"**
Share with core team/stakeholders. Show them the README for 30-minute overview.
