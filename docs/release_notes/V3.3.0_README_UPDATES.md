## Changes Made

### 1. Updated Tool Count Throughout
- **Changed:** References from "20 tools" to "22 tools"
- **Locations:** 
  - Tier Configuration section
  - MCP Tools Reference section
  - Stats section
  - Release summary table
  - Docker health check example

### 2. Enhanced Tier Configuration Section
**Added comprehensive tier differentiation:**
- Updated tier descriptions with specific capability details
- Added link references to all three tier testing documents:
  - Community Tier Testing verification
  - Pro Tier Testing verification
  - Enterprise Tier Testing verification

### 3. Added "Understanding Tier Differences" Table
**New comparison table showing:**
- Tool Access: All 22 tools at all tiers ✅
- Security Findings: 50 (Community) → Unlimited (Pro/Enterprise)
- Symbolic Paths: 3/5/10 (Community) → 10/10 (Pro) → Unlimited (Enterprise)
- Graph Traversal: k=1/20 nodes → k=5/100 nodes → Unlimited with query language
- File Limits: 100 → 1,000 → Unlimited
- Code Extraction capabilities per tier
- Context Awareness levels
- Analysis Depth features
- Cross-File capabilities
- Semantic Features availability
- Compliance support
- Custom Policy availability

**Added "When to Upgrade" guidance:**
- Community: Small projects, learning, hobbyist use
- Pro: Professional development, context-aware scanning, larger codebases
- Enterprise: Organization-wide deployment, compliance, custom policies, monorepo

### 4. Expanded "What's New in v3.3.0" Section
**Added new subsection: "All 22 Tools at All Tiers"**
- Explanation of the paradigm shift (all tools accessible to all tiers)
- Clear description of what changes across tiers (capabilities, limits, features)
- Tool count evolution: v3.0.0-v3.2.0 (20 tools with locks) → v3.3.0+ (22 tools, all accessible)

### 5. Comprehensive MCP Tools Reference Rewrite
**Replaced simple description table with tier-aware capability tables:**

#### Organized by category:
1. **Core Analysis Tools (8 tools)**
   - Each tool shows Community/Pro/Enterprise capabilities
   - Examples: analyze_code, security_scan, symbolic_execute, etc.

2. **Context & Graph Tools (7 tools)**
   - Tier-specific limits and features
   - Examples: get_file_context, get_symbol_references, get_call_graph, etc.

3. **Security & Policy Tools (4 tools)**
   - Capability progression across tiers
   - Examples: unified_sink_detect, cross_file_security_scan, etc.

4. **Infrastructure & Compliance Tools (3 tools)**
   - Tier-specific validation and policy features
   - Examples: validate_paths, verify_policy_integrity, code_policy_check

#### Added comprehensive capability matrix:
- **Community Tier (Free)** - 7 bullet points with specific limits
- **Pro Tier** - 11 bullet points showing additions over Community
- **Enterprise Tier** - 11 bullet points showing additions over Pro

#### Added practical examples by tier:
- Community: Basic security scan (max 50 findings)
- Pro: Context-aware scanning with sanitizer recognition
- Enterprise: Custom policy enforcement with compliance reporting

### 6. Enhanced Features Section
**Reorganized Security Analysis with tier awareness:**

**Community Tier - OWASP Top 10 (50 findings max)**
- Listed all 11 vulnerability types with CWE mappings
- Clear max findings limit

**Pro Tier - Context-Aware Scanning (Unlimited findings)**
- All Community features +
- 5 additional Pro-specific features (sanitizer recognition, confidence scoring, etc.)

**Enterprise Tier - Custom Policy Engine (Unlimited)**
- All Pro features +
- 6 additional Enterprise-specific features (custom policies, cross-file taint, compliance, etc.)

### 7. Updated Stats Section
**Added tier-related statistics:**
- **22** MCP tools (updated from 20)
- **3** tier levels explicitly mentioned
- **~150-200** tokens saved per response (configurable output v3.3.0)
- Clarified that all tiers get all tools

### 8. Updated Release Timeline
**Added v3.3.0 to roadmap:**
- v3.2.0: Released Dec 25, 2025 (Enhanced Extraction)
- v3.3.0: Current Dec 30, 2025 (All Tools, All Tiers)
- v3.4.0: Planned Q1 2026 (Release Solidification)

### 9. Updated Release Summary Table
**Modified v3.0.0 release notes:**
- MCP Tools: "21 tools" → "22 tools"
- Added note: "All tools available at all tiers (v3.3.0+)"
- Added "Tier System: 3 tiers - Community (free), Pro, Enterprise"

## Documentation Consistency

All changes maintain consistency with:
- `docs/analysis/tool_validation/COMMUNITY_TIER_TOOL_TESTING.md` (22 tools verified)
- `docs/analysis/tool_validation/PRO_TIER_TOOL_TESTING.md` (22 tools verified)
- `docs/analysis/tool_validation/ENTERPRISE_TIER_TOOL_TESTING.md` (22 tools verified)
- Individual tool verification documents showing tier-specific capabilities

---

## Impact

**User Benefits:**
1. **Clarity:** Users immediately understand they get all tools regardless of tier
2. **Transparency:** Clear visibility into what differs across tiers (capabilities/limits, not access)
3. **Guidance:** "When to Upgrade" section helps users make informed decisions
4. **Completeness:** Comprehensive tool reference with tier-specific details

**Technical Accuracy:**
- All tool counts updated to reflect 22 tools
- All tier capabilities verified against implementation
- All limits documented from actual tier testing verification documents
