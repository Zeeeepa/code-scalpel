# Code Scalpel Enterprise Compliance - One-Pager

**Automated Compliance Scanning for HIPAA, SOC2, GDPR, and PCI-DSS**

---

## What It Does

Code Scalpel automatically scans your codebase for compliance violations across healthcare (HIPAA), security (SOC2), privacy (GDPR), and payment card (PCI-DSS) standards. Get detailed reports with specific violations, line numbers, and remediation steps.

### 30-Second Demo

**BEFORE:**
```python
# ❌ HIPAA violation
logging.info(f"Patient SSN: {patient.ssn}")
```

**SCAN:**
```bash
code-scalpel check --standard hipaa
```

**RESULT:**
```
❌ HIPAA001 (CRITICAL) - Line 2
Description: PHI in log statement
Fix: Use anonymized identifiers instead
```

**AFTER:**
```python
# ✅ HIPAA compliant
logging.info(f"Patient ID: {patient.id}")
```
