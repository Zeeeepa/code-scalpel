## When to Use Each Approach

### Use Code Scalpel Enterprise When:

✅ You need **automated compliance scanning** (HIPAA, SOC2, GDPR, PCI-DSS)  
✅ You want **fast results** (seconds, not weeks)  
✅ You need **CI/CD integration** for continuous compliance  
✅ You want **AI agent integration** (Claude, Copilot)  
✅ You need **PDF reports** for auditors  
✅ You have **budget constraints** (<$100/month vs $50K+/year)

### Use Manual Audits When:

⚠️ You need **100% accuracy** (zero false negatives)  
⚠️ You have **complex edge cases** not covered by automated tools  
⚠️ You need **legal attestation** (automated tools can't sign off)  
⚠️ You have **unlimited budget and time**

### Use Generic Linters When:

⚠️ You only need **code style** checking (not compliance)  
⚠️ You don't need **specific standard references** (HIPAA001, etc.)  
⚠️ You have **time to write custom rules** for compliance  
⚠️ You're okay with **high false positive rates**

### Use Compliance Consultants When:

⚠️ You need **strategic compliance guidance**  
⚠️ You need **policy and procedure creation**  
⚠️ You need **training and education**  
⚠️ You have **complex organizational requirements**

## ROI Calculator

### Your Scenario

**Codebase Size:** _________ LOC  
**Compliance Standards:** ☐ HIPAA ☐ SOC2 ☐ GDPR ☐ PCI-DSS  
**Current Annual Compliance Cost:** $__________  
**Engineering Hours Spent on Compliance:** _________ hours/year

### Estimated Code Scalpel ROI

```
Annual Savings = Current Cost + (Eng Hours × $200/hr) - $1,188
ROI % = (Annual Savings / $1,188) × 100
Payback Period = $1,188 / (Monthly Savings)
```

**Example (Healthcare Startup):**
- Current Cost: $65,000/year
- Eng Hours: 320 hours/year @ $200/hr = $64,000
- Code Scalpel: $1,188/year

**Annual Savings:** $127,812  
**ROI:** 10,759%  
**Payback Period:** <1 month
