## [Drafting] Missing Sections
*> **Note:** The following sections are required by the Table of Contents (v1.1) but are currently not implemented in the body text. Please populate these sections and move them to their correct chronological position in the document.*

### Architecture and Implementation
> **TODO:** Provide a detailed explanation of the tool's internal architecture.
> *   Explain the AST visitor pattern used for different languages.
> *   Detail the difference between the `SecurityVisitor` (Python) and regex/pattern matchers for other languages.
> *   Include a diagram or description of how `detect_vulnerabilities` orchestrates the scan.

### Security Considerations
> **TODO:** Discuss the security of the tool itself.
> *   Are there risks in parsing malicious ASTs? (e.g., Billion Laughs attack if XML involved, or infinite recursion in CFG).
> *   How are secrets handled if found? (Redaction in logs?).
> *   Clarify that this tool is a static analyzer and cannot verify runtime environment security.

### Integration Patterns
> **TODO:** Describe how other tools should consume this tool.
> *   **CI/CD:** How to interpret exit codes or JSON results in a pipeline.
> *   **IDE:** Recommendations for utilizing findings in an editor extension.
> *   **Agentic:** Best prompt patterns for AI agents to interpret `security_scan` results (e.g., "Fix these high severity issues first").

### Roadmap and Future Plans
> **TODO:** Outline future development for v1.2+.
> *   Support for C# and Go (planned for Q2).
> *   Deep Taint Analysis for JavaScript (currently Sink Detection only).
> *   Integration with `scan_dependencies` for a unified report.

### Troubleshooting
> **TODO:** Common issues and fixes.
> *   **Issue:** "Scan timed out on large file." -> **Fix:** Increase timeout or ignore minified files.
> *   **Issue:** "Syntax Error during parsing." -> **Fix:** Ensure code snippet is valid syntax for the specified language.
> *   **Issue:** "False positive on SQLi." -> **Fix:** Explain how to annotate code or use proper sanitizers to clear taint.

## Executive Summary

### Purpose Statement
The `security_scan` tool is the primary Single-File Static Application Security Testing (SAST) engine in Code Scalpel. It identifies critical security vulnerabilities—such as SQL Injection, XSS, and Command Injection—by analyzing source code without executing it. For Python, it utilizes sophisticated **Taint Analysis** to track dangerous data flows from sources (inputs) to sinks (vulnerable functions), significantly reducing false positives compared to simple regex scanners. For JavaScript, TypeScript, and Java, it enforces strict **Sink Detection** to flag dangerous patterns.

### Key Benefits
- **Zero Execution Risk:** Analyzes ASTs statically; never executes potentially malicious code.
- **High Precision (Python):** Uses data flow analysis to understand if input is sanitized before use.
- **Polyglot Support:** Covers Python (Full Taint), JavaScript, TypeScript, and Java (Sink Detection).
- **Compliance Ready:** Maps all findings to standard Weakness Enumerations (CWE) and OWASP Top 10 categories.
- **Educational:** Pro tier provides detailed remediation hints and confidence scoring to help developers fix issues.

### Quick Stats
| Metric | Value |
|--------|-------|
| **Tool Version** | v1.0 |
| **Code Scalpel Version** | v3.3.0 |
| **Release Date** | 2026-01-07 (Feature Complete) |
| **Test Coverage** | 100% (59+ tests passed) |
| **Performance** | <200ms per file average |
| **Languages Supported** | Python, JavaScript, TypeScript, Java |
| **Vulnerability Types** | SQLi, XSS, Command Inj, Path Traversal, Secrets, etc. |

### When to Use This Tool
- **Primary Use Case:** verifying code safety before deployment or during code review.
- **Secondary Use Cases:**
  - Auditing legacy code for known vulnerability patterns.
  - Ensuring AI-generated code does not introduce security flaws.
  - Checking for hardcoded secrets (API keys, passwords).
- **Not Suitable For:**
  - Cross-file data flow analysis (use `cross_file_security_scan` in Enterprise).
  - Runtime application security testing (RAST).
  - Dependency vulnerability scanning (use `scan_dependencies`).

## Technical Overview

### Core Functionality
The tool operates in two modes depending on the language:
1.  **Taint Analysis (Python):** Builds a Control Flow Graph (CFG) to track "tainted" variables from entry points (e.g., `request.args`) to dangerous sinks (e.g., `cursor.execute`). It recognizes "sanitizers" (e.g., `escape_string`) that neutralize taint, preventing false positives.
2.  **Sink/Pattern Detection (Polyglot):** Scans ASTs for known dangerous function calls (e.g., `eval()`, `innerHTML`) and patterns (e.g., hardcoded AWS keys).

### Design Principles
1.  **False Positive Reduction:** Prioritizes precision. If a flow is sanitized, it is not reported (in Python).
2.  **Standardized Reporting:** All findings return a consistent JSON structure with CWE ID, severity, and line numbers.
3.  **Tiered Depth:** Community users get essential safety checks; Enterprise users get deep compliance and custom rule support.

### Integration Context
`security_scan` is the **gatekeeper** in the modification workflow:

    A[AI Agent] -->|Generates Code| B[simulate_refactor]

## Testing Evidence

Based on [Security Scan Status Report](../../testing/test_assessments/v1.0%20tools/security_scan/security_scan_STATUS.md) dated Jan 3, 2026.

| Category | Stats | Status |
|----------|-------|--------|
| **Total Tests** | 59 | ✅ Passing |
| **Tier Validation** | Community, Pro, Enterprise | ✅ Verified |
| **False Positives** | Parameterized queries, ORM patterns | ✅ Verified |
| **Pro Features** | NoSQL, Secrets, Confidence | ✅ Verified |

**Key Scenarios Validated:**
*   **Tier Limits:** Confirmed Community tier caps findings at 50.
*   **Sanitization:** Verified that using `sqlalchemy.text()` or variable binding suppresses SQLi warnings in Python.
*   **Feature Gates:** Verified that Secret Detection returns empty in Community tier.

---

## Performance Characteristics

*   **Latency:**
    *   Parse Time: ~20-50ms
    *   Analysis Time: ~50-150ms (increases with chain depth)
    *   Total: <200ms typical
*   **Memory:** Efficient AST traversal; does not load full project graph (unlike Cross-File scan).

## Tier-Specific Behavior

| Feature | Community | Pro | Enterprise |
| :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **Finding Limit** | 50 | Unlimited | Unlimited |
| **Languages** | Polyglot | Polyglot | Polyglot |
| **Taint Depth** | Basic (Intra-func) | Sensitive (Data flow) | Deep (Cross-func) |
| **Secrets** | ❌ | ✅ | ✅ |
| **Remediation** | ❌ | ✅ | ✅ |
| **Compliance** | ❌ | ❌ | ✅ |

## Known Limitations

1.  **Language Disparity:** Python support is significantly deeper (Taint Analysis) than JS/TS/Java (Sink Detection).
2.  **Cross-File Blindness:** This tool analyzes single files. If taint comes from another file, it may be missed (use Enterprise findings for cross-file).
3.  **Dynamic Code:** `eval()` or dynamic attribute access in Python can confuse the static analyzer.
