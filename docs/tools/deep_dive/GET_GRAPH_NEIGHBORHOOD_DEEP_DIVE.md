## Executive Summary

### Purpose Statement
The `get_graph_neighborhood` tool addresses the "Exploding Graph Problem" in large-scale code analysis. Instead of processing an entire project's call graph (which can consume massive memory and tokens), it extracts a localized subgraph around a specific "center node." It supports filtering by edge direction, confidence levels, and (in Enterprise tiers) a Cypher-like query language. This allows AI agents to surgically explore dependency chains without loading the entire codebase.

### Key Benefits
- **Memory Safety:** Prevents Out-Of-Memory (OOM) errors by enforcing node limits and truncation protection.
- **Focused Analysis:** Restricts context to relevant k-hop neighbors (e.g., "what calls this function directly?").
- **Semantic Intelligence:** (Pro+) Identifies functionally similar nodes using name/docstring similarity, not just direct calls.
- **Query Flexibility:** (Enterprise) Supports complex graph traversals via a custom query language.
- **Visual Validation:** Auto-generates Mermaid diagrams for immediate visual verification of relationships.

### Quick Stats
| Metric | Value |
|--------|-------|
| **Tool Version** | v1.0 |
| **Code Scalpel Version** | v3.3.1 |
| **Release Date** | 2026-01-04 (Production Ready) |
| **Test Coverage** | 99.2% (250 tests passed) |
| **Performance** | <100ms for neighborhood extraction (target) |
| **Scale** | Supports unlimited nodes in Enterprise tier |
| **Limits** | Community: k=1, Pro: k=5, Enterprise: Unlimited |

### When to Use This Tool
- **Primary Use Case:** Investigating the immediate impact of changing a specific function or class.
- **Secondary Use Cases:**
  - Tracing data flow through a limited path.
  - Understanding dependencies of a module without reading all files.
  - Visualizing local architecture via Mermaid.
- **Not Suitable For:**
  - Full codebase visualization (too large).
  - Simple file reading (use `get_file_context`).
  - Finding all references across the entire project (use `get_symbol_references` for simple lists).

## Technical Overview

### Core Functionality
The tool operates on a pre-indexed graph of the codebase (or builds it on-demand for smaller scopes). It performs a Breadth-First Search (BFS) starting from a `center_node_id`, expanding outwards up to `k` hops.
- **Pruning:** Stops traversal if `max_nodes` or `max_k` is reached.
- **Filtering:** Includes/excludes edges based on `direction` (incoming/outgoing) and `min_confidence`.
- **Enrichment:** (Pro/Ent) Adds semantic edges based on embeddings/similarity and logical edges (e.g., Producer-Consumer patterns).

### Design Principles
1.  **Safety Limits:** Hard limits on traversal depth (`k`) and size (`max_nodes`) to protect agent context windows.
2.  **Honest Uncertainty:** Returns explicit `truncation_warning` if the graph was cut short, so the AI knows its view is incomplete.
3.  **Visual Output:** Always returns a Mermaid diagram string to help humans and agents visualize the structure.

### Integration Context
`get_graph_neighborhood` is often used after determining a file is relevant:

```mermaid
graph TD
    A[get_file_context] -->|Identify Target| B[get_graph_neighborhood]
    B -->|Viz| C[Mermaid Diagram]
    B -->|Context| D[extract_code]
    D --> E[Refactor/Analysis]
```

## Features and Capabilities

### Community Tier (Structural Base)
Focuses on safe, localized exploration.
*   **k-hop Traversal:** Limited to k=1 (immediate neighbors).
*   **Direction Filtering:** Filter by `incoming`, `outgoing`, or `both`.
*   **Confidence Threshold:** Filter weak edges (e.g., probable but unverified calls).
*   **Truncation Protection:** Max 20 nodes; warns if limit exceeded.
*   **Visualization:** Auto-generated Mermaid diagram.

### Pro Tier (Semantic Intelligence)
Adds understanding of "meaning" and logical patterns.
*   **Extended Range:** Up to k=5 hops.
*   **Semantic Neighbors:** Identifies nodes that are *similar* in intent, even if not explicitly connected (via vector embeddings/Jaccard similarity).
*   **Logical Relationships:** Detects patterns like Factory/Product, Producer/Consumer.
*   **Smart Caching:** Advanced caching strategies for performance.
*   **Capacity:** Max 100 nodes.

### Enterprise Tier (Query & Scale)
Unlocks full graph power.
*   **Unlimited Scale:** No hard limits on `k` or `max_nodes`.
*   **Graph Query Language:** Supports Cypher-like syntax for custom selection (e.g., `MATCH (n)-[:calls]->(m) WHERE m.name CONTAINS 'DB'`).
*   **Path Constraints:** Find specific paths or flows.
*   **Hot Spot Detection:** Identifies high-degree nodes in the subgraph.

    min_confidence: float = 0.0,
    # Implicit tier config injected
    **kwargs

## Usage Examples

### 1. Basic Impact Analysis (Community)
**Request:**
```python
await get_graph_neighborhood(
    center_node_id="python::services::OrderService",
    k=1,
    direction="incoming"
)
```
**Goal:** Find out who calls `OrderService`.

### 2. Deep Dependency Trace (Pro)
**Request:**
```python
await get_graph_neighborhood(
    center_node_id="python::services::OrderService",
    k=3,
    min_confidence=0.8
)
```
**Goal:** Trace dependencies 3 layers deep, ignoring low-confidence guesses.

### 3. Custom Query (Enterprise)
**Request:**
```python
await get_graph_neighborhood(
    center_node_id="python::controllers::API",
    query="MATCH (n)-[:calls]->(m) WHERE m.layer == 'database'"
)
```
**Goal:** Find all database interactions originating from the API controller.

## Performance Characteristics

*   **Latency:** Targeted <100ms for standard extractions.
*   **Scalability:** Uses incremental loading to handle large repositories without loading the full graph into memory.
*   **Caching:** Pro/Enterprise tiers utilize smart caching to return repeated queries instantly.

## Tier-Specific Behavior

| Feature | Community | Pro | Enterprise |
| :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **Max Hops (k)** | 1 | 5 | Unlimited |
| **Max Nodes** | 20 | 100 | Unlimited |
| **Semantic Analysis** | No | Yes | Yes |
| **Query Language** | No | No | Yes |

## Known Limitations

1.  **Dynamic Dispatch:** Static analysis may miss calls made via reflection or dynamic usage (Python/JS).
2.  **Incomplete Code:** If the AST cannot parse a file, it won't appear in the graph.
3.  **Graph Size:** Extremely connected "God Classes" may trigger truncation warnings immediately, requiring higher `max_nodes` limits valid only in higher tiers.
