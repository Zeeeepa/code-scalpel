# Code Scalpel Beta Tester Outreach Strategy

## Target Personas & Approach

---

### Persona 1: The AI Startup CTO

**Profile:**
- Name archetype: "Alex Chen"
- Role: CTO/Tech Lead at Series A/B AI startup (10-50 engineers)
- Pain points: Code review bottlenecks, security concerns with AI-generated code, scaling dev velocity
- Where they hang out: Twitter/X, Hacker News, YC Slack, First Round Capital network
- Motivation: Competitive advantage, shipping faster, reducing tech debt

**Value Proposition:**
> "Your engineers are using Copilot/Cursor but you have no idea if the generated code is secure. Code Scalpel gives you deterministic security scanning and governance without slowing down your AI-assisted workflow."

**Outreach Template:**
```
Subject: Giving your AI coding tools guardrails (not handcuffs)

Hi [Name],

I noticed [Company] is scaling quickly and likely using AI coding assistants.
We built Code Scalpel specifically for teams in your position—where you need
the velocity of AI-assisted development but can't afford security blind spots.

Quick stats from our tool:
- 6 vulnerability types detected in 9ms (vs manual review taking hours)
- 99% token reduction = your AI agents can analyze 100K LOC codebases
- Zero hallucinations—AST-based, mathematically verified results

Would love to give you Pro/Enterprise licenses for your team to test.
No strings attached—just looking for honest feedback from builders like you.

15-min call or async via Loom?
```

**Where to Find Them:**
- YC Startup Directory (filter for AI/ML companies)
- LinkedIn (CTO + "AI" + Series A/B)
- Twitter lists of AI startup founders
- AngelList/Wellfound

### Persona 2: The DevRel / Developer Advocate

**Profile:**
- Name archetype: "Jordan Martinez"
- Role: DevRel at Anthropic, OpenAI, Vercel, Supabase, or similar
- Pain points: Constantly evaluating tools for their community, creating content, staying ahead
- Where they hang out: Twitter/X, Discord servers, YouTube, conference circuits
- Motivation: Content opportunities, being first to showcase new tech, community value

**Value Proposition:**
> "Code Scalpel is the first MCP-native security and analysis toolkit. Your community building AI agents will want to know about this."

**Outreach Template:**
```
Subject: MCP tool your community will want to see

Hi [Name],

Love your content on [specific video/post].

We built Code Scalpel—22 MCP tools that give AI agents deterministic
code analysis capabilities (AST parsing, security scanning, symbolic execution).

The hook for your audience: "What if your AI agent could mathematically
prove code is secure instead of just guessing?"

Happy to:
- Give you Enterprise access to test
- Do a technical deep-dive for content
- Provide exclusive early access for your community

This could make a great "hidden gem tools" or "AI agent security" piece.
```

**Where to Find Them:**
- Anthropic Discord (look for active community members)
- Twitter DevRel circles (@swyx, @aiDotEngineer followers)
- YouTube AI coding channels
- Dev.to and Hashnode top authors

---

### Persona 3: The Open Source AI Framework Maintainer

**Profile:**
- Name archetype: "Sam Patel"
- Role: Core contributor to LangChain, CrewAI, AutoGen, Semantic Kernel, or DSPy
- Pain points: Security concerns in agentic systems, need for reliable tool integrations
- Where they hang out: GitHub, Discord (framework-specific), Twitter/X
- Motivation: Improving their framework, recognition, solving hard problems

**Value Proposition:**
> "Your framework executes untrusted AI-generated code. Code Scalpel provides the security layer you've been missing—and it's MCP-native so integration is trivial."

**Outreach Template:**
```
Subject: Security layer for [Framework] agents

Hi [Name],

Been following [Framework]'s progress—impressive work on [specific feature].

One gap I've noticed in agentic AI: there's no good way to verify code
an agent generates before execution. We built Code Scalpel to solve this.

For [Framework] specifically:
- Pre-execution security scan (SQL injection, XSS, etc.) in <50ms
- Symbolic execution to find edge cases before runtime
- Works via MCP—drop-in integration

Would love your feedback on whether this would be valuable as a recommended
tool or even a native integration. Happy to provide Enterprise access.

GitHub: [link]
```

**Where to Find Them:**
- GitHub contributor graphs for major AI frameworks
- Framework Discord servers (look for maintainer roles)
- Twitter (often have "maintainer @framework" in bio)

---

### Persona 4: The Enterprise Security Engineer

**Profile:**
- Name archetype: "Morgan Williams"
- Role: AppSec Engineer or Security Architect at Fortune 500
- Pain points: Developers adopting AI tools faster than security can evaluate, compliance requirements
- Where they hang out: LinkedIn, OWASP chapters, security conferences (BSides, DEF CON)
- Motivation: Risk reduction, compliance, not being the bottleneck

**Value Proposition:**
> "Developers are using AI coding tools whether you approve or not. Code Scalpel gives you visibility and guardrails without blocking productivity."

**Outreach Template:**
```
Subject: Governance layer for AI-assisted development

Hi [Name],

Security teams are in a tough spot—developers love AI coding tools,
but there's no good way to ensure generated code meets security standards.

Code Scalpel provides:
- OWASP Top 10 scanning via taint analysis (not pattern matching)
- Cryptographic policy integrity verification
- Audit trails for compliance (SOC2, HIPAA mapping available)
- Works with any AI tool via MCP protocol

We're offering Enterprise licenses to security leaders willing to
evaluate and provide feedback. Would [Company] be interested in a pilot?

Happy to do a technical demo focused on your compliance requirements.
```

**Where to Find Them:**
- LinkedIn (AppSec + Fortune 500)
- OWASP chapter leads
- Security conference speaker lists
- r/netsec, r/cybersecurity (carefully, no spam)

### Persona 5: The AI Agent Builder / Power User

**Profile:**
- Name archetype: "Riley Thompson"
- Role: Independent developer or small team building AI agent products
- Pain points: Context window limits, unreliable AI outputs, security concerns
- Where they hang out: Twitter/X, Reddit (r/LocalLLaMA, r/ClaudeAI), YouTube
- Motivation: Building better products, technical excellence, indie hacker success

**Value Proposition:**
> "Stop feeding your AI agent entire files. Code Scalpel extracts exactly what's needed—200 tokens instead of 15,000. Your agent just got 75x more effective."

**Outreach Template:**
```
Subject: Your AI agents are wasting 99% of their context window

Hi [Name],

Saw your project [specific project]—cool approach to [specific thing].

Quick thought: if your agent reads files to understand code, it's
probably consuming 10-15K tokens per file. Code Scalpel can extract
just the function/class needed in ~200 tokens.

Also does:
- Security scanning before code execution
- Symbolic execution for test generation
- All via MCP (works with Claude, GPT, local models)

Want a Pro license to test? No pitch call required—just trying to
get feedback from serious builders.
```

**Where to Find Them:**
- Twitter #buildinpublic
- Reddit AI subreddits
- Indie Hackers
- Product Hunt AI tool launches (commenters who ask good questions)

---

### Persona 6: The Technical Content Creator

**Profile:**
- Name archetype: "Casey Lee"
- Role: YouTuber, course creator, or technical blogger (10K-500K followers)
- Pain points: Finding new tools to cover, staying relevant, creating valuable content
- Where they hang out: YouTube, Twitter/X, their own Discord communities
- Motivation: Content opportunities, audience growth, sponsorship potential

**Value Proposition:**
> "Code Scalpel is the kind of 'hidden gem' tool your audience loves discovering. First MCP-native security toolkit for AI agents."

**Outreach Template:**
```
Subject: AI coding security tool for your "tools you need to know" series

Hi [Name],

Love your [specific video] on AI coding tools. Your breakdown of
[specific thing] was exactly what developers needed.

Built something your audience might dig: Code Scalpel—22 MCP tools
that give AI agents abilities like:
- Security scanning in <50ms
- Symbolic execution (Z3 solver) for test generation
- 99% token reduction via surgical code extraction

The visual demos are compelling (before/after token counts,
vulnerability detection in real-time).

Happy to provide:
- Enterprise access for testing
- Technical walkthrough for your content
- Exclusive discount code for your audience

No pressure on timeline—whenever it fits your content calendar.
```

**Target Creators:**
- Fireship (Jeff Delaney)
- Traversy Media
- The AI Advantage
- Matthew Berman
- AI Jason
- Code to the Moon
