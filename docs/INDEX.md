---

### For Tool Developers

**Essential Reading:**
1. QUICK_REFERENCE.md → [For Tool Developers](#for-tool-developers-new-pattern-required)
2. PRE_RELEASE_PIPELINE.md → [Design Patterns](#design-patterns--best-practices)
3. PRE_RELEASE_PIPELINE.md → [Adding New Tier-Gated Features](#adding-a-new-tier-gated-feature)

**What You Need to Know:**
- ❌ Don't: Hardcode tier limits in tool code
- ✅ Do: Read limits from `get_tool_capabilities()`
- ✅ Do: Use `limits.toml` as single source of truth
- ✅ Do: Write tests for each tier
- ⚠️ Remember: All 23 tools always registered, schema never changes

---

### For DevOps Engineers

**Essential Reading:**
1. QUICK_REFERENCE.md → [For DevOps](#for-devops-new-secrets-required)
2. PRE_RELEASE_PIPELINE.md → [License Architecture](#license-architecture-existing-enhanced)
3. PRE_RELEASE_PIPELINE.md → [CI/CD Pipeline Specification](#cicd-pipeline-specification)

**What You Need to Do:**
- [ ] Configure GitHub secrets: `CODESCALPEL_LICENSE_PRO` and `CODESCALPEL_LICENSE_ENTERPRISE`
- [ ] Deploy 8-stage GitHub Actions workflow
- [ ] Set calendar reminder: 30 days before license expiry
- [ ] Implement secret rotation procedure

---

### For QA Engineers

**Essential Reading:**
1. QUICK_REFERENCE.md → [For QA](#for-qa-new-test-coverage)
2. PRE_RELEASE_PIPELINE.md → [Test Matrix & Coverage](#test-matrix--coverage)
3. PRE_RELEASE_PIPELINE.md → [Enforcement Rules](#enforcement-rules--blockers)

**What You'll Test:**
- Tool availability (23 tools × 3 tiers = 69 tests)
- Tier limits (enforcement, not just documentation)
- License validation (secrets injection, expiry)
- Capability snapshots (regression detection)
- All 3 transports (stdio, HTTP, Docker)

**Total Coverage:** ~300 tests, 15-minute runtime

---

### For Product Managers

**Essential Reading:**
1. QUICK_REFERENCE.md → [For Product](#for-product-what-changes)
2. PRE_RELEASE_PIPELINE.md → [Core Principles](#core-principles)
3. PRE_RELEASE_PIPELINE.md → [Capability Model](#capability-model)

**What Changes:**
- Pricing is now **executable code** (tested in CI)
- Capabilities are **discoverable** (agents can query)
- Changes are **auditable** (golden files show diffs)
- Releases are **validated** (no pricing escapes)

**Tier Change Process:**
1. Update limits in `limits.toml`
2. PR generates new capability snapshot
3. CI shows diff for review
4. Approve with "regenerate-capabilities" label
5. Golden files auto-update on merge
6. Release with confidence

---

## Key Concepts Explained

### Stable Tool Surface
**What It Means:** All 23 tools always present, never hidden

- ✅ 23 tools in tool list (always)
- ✅ Tool schemas immutable
- ❌ No per-tier tool hiding
- ❌ No per-tier schema changes

**Why?** Prevents LLM agents from hallucinating unavailable tools

---

### Capability Envelope
**What It Means:** Runtime vector describing what's available

```json
{
  "tier": "pro",
  "tools": {
    "analyze_code": {
      "available": true,
      "max_files": 5000,
      "max_depth": 15
    },
    "unified_sink_detect": {
      "available": false,
      "requires_tier": "enterprise"
    }
  }
}
```

**Queryable Via:**
- MPC method: `capabilities/get`
- CLI: `codescalpel capabilities --json`
- Programmatically: `get_tool_capabilities(tool_id)`

---

### Golden Capability Files
**What They Are:** Committed reference files for regression testing

- `capabilities/community.json` - All capabilities at COMMUNITY tier
- `capabilities/pro.json` - All capabilities at PRO tier
- `capabilities/enterprise.json` - All capabilities at ENTERPRISE tier

**What Happens on Change:**
1. Code changes → CI generates new capability
2. CI compares against golden file
3. If different → CI fails with diff
4. Developer reviews diff
5. If intentional → Approve PR with "regenerate-capabilities" label
6. Golden file auto-regenerates on merge

---

### Blocker Violations
**What They Are:** Tests that MUST pass for release

| Blocker | Why | Example |
|---------|-----|---------|
| Tool count ≠ 22 | Schema stability | Expected 22, got 21 |
| Schema changed | Client contract | Input type changed |
| Limits not enforced | Pricing integrity | PRO can access FREE limit |
| Capability mismatch | Pricing audit | max_files changed without approval |
| License not injected | Tier detection | Secret empty |

**CI Behavior:** Automatic PR block (no manual override possible)

## Common Questions

**Q: Do I need to read the entire 50KB document?**
A: No. Start with QUICK_REFERENCE.md (2 min), then read relevant sections in PRE_RELEASE_PIPELINE.md as needed.

**Q: When do I need this?**
A: Immediately if you're on implementation team. Soon if you're a tool developer. Before release for everyone else.

**Q: What if I don't understand something?**
A: Check the FAQ section in PRE_RELEASE_PIPELINE.md. Ask your team lead.

**Q: Can we start before all 4 phases?**
A: No. Phase 1 foundation is required before phases 2-4.

**Q: What if the timeline slips?**
A: Document will be updated. Current plan: 4 weeks.
