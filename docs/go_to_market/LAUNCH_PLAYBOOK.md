**Owner:** Tim (with stakeholder input)
- [ ] Community base reaches 5K monthly active users
- [ ] Early case studies validate willingness to pay
- [ ] Enterprise pilot feedback is positive
- [ ] Pricing model is finalized
**Timeline:** September 2026 (recommended)

### Decision: When to Hire Sales
**Owner:** Tim (with board/advisor input)
- [ ] Monthly revenue reaches $5K+
- [ ] Enterprise leads exceeding sales capacity (>10/month)
- [ ] 3+ concurrent enterprise negotiations
- [ ] Revenue growth rate >20% month-over-month
**Timeline:** July-August 2026 (recommended)

### Escalation: If GitHub Stars Lag Behind
**Target:** 500+ by end of April
**Action:** 
1. Increase content frequency (3x/week)
2. Reach out to influencers for amplification
3. Double ProductHunt efforts
4. Publish comparison vs Copilot/SonarQube

### Escalation: If Enterprise Adoption Slower Than Expected
**Target:** 3+ customers by end of April
**Action:**
1. Research actual pain points (survey)
2. Create targeted case studies for pain points
3. Build custom integrations for prospect companies
4. Hire enterprise sales consultant for guidance

### Escalation: If Performance Issues Surface
**Action:**

---

## Contingency Plans

### Scenario 1: Competitor Launches Similar Product
**Mitigation:**
- Emphasize first-mover advantage
- Highlight depth of testing (4,700+ tests)
- Leverage community (lock-in effect)
- Accelerate feature development (v3.4, v3.5, v4.0)

### Scenario 2: GitHub Copilot Integrates Verification Features
**Mitigation:**
- Remain vendor-agnostic (works with Copilot or Claude or others)
- Emphasize governance/policy (Copilot won't have this)
- Target enterprises uncomfortable with Microsoft lock-in
- Accelerate enterprise sales

### Scenario 3: PyPI/GitHub Has Service Outage on Launch Day
**Mitigation:**
- Have backup: Publish to conda-forge simultaneously
- Mirror on: Docker Hub, GitHub Releases, custom website
- Communicate transparently ("We're ready when [platform] is")
- Reschedule if needed (don't force a bad launch)

### Scenario 4: Critical Security Vulnerability Discovered
**Mitigation:**
- Immediate patch (within 4 hours)
- Transparent communication (blog post explaining fix)
- Third-party security audit (to restore trust)
- Implement "responsible disclosure" process
