# Code Scalpel - Executive Summary & Strategic Overview

**Status:** Ready for Go-to-Market  
**Version:** 1.0  
**Prepared:** January 2026

---

## One-Page Strategic Summary

### What is Code Scalpel?

An **MCP server toolkit for AI agents** that provides **deterministic code analysis and modification** using:
- **AST (Abstract Syntax Trees)** - Exact code structure parsing
- **PDG (Program Dependence Graphs)** - Precise data flow tracking
- **Z3 Solver** - Mathematical path exploration
- **Cryptographic Governance** - Immutable policy enforcement

**In Plain English:** While GitHub Copilot *suggests* code, Code Scalpel *proves* it's safe.

### Market Opportunity

**Total Addressable Market (TAM):** $8-12B by 2027
- 3-5M developers using AI coding tools (growing 200%/year)
- $20-100B in enterprise software development spending
- $5-10B in compliance/security spending

**Serviceable Addressable Market (SAM):** $200-500M by 2027
- Enterprise development teams (compliance-critical)
- Financial services, healthcare, government sectors
- Security-conscious organizations

### Current State (v3.3.0)

| Metric | Value | Status |
|--------|-------|--------|
| **MCP Tools** | 21 production-ready | ✅ Released |
| **Code Coverage** | 94.86% | ✅ >90% gate |
| **Test Pass Rate** | 97.93% | ✅ >95% gate |
| **GitHub Stars** | ~100 (pre-release) | 📈 Growing |
| **PyPI Stability** | Production release | ✅ Stable |
| **Security CVEs** | 0 critical | ✅ Secure |
| **Tier System** | Community/Pro/Enterprise | ✅ Implemented |

### Strategic Positioning

**Market Position:** The **infrastructure layer for trustworthy AI-assisted development**

**Key Differentiators:**
1. ✅ Only **deterministic** verification (AST+PDG+Z3)
2. ✅ **Enterprise governance** by design (cryptographic policy)
3. ✅ **MCP-native** architecture (vendor-agnostic)
4. ✅ **99% token efficiency** (surgical extraction)
5. ✅ **Compliance-ready** (audit trails, policy verification)

### Revenue Model

| Tier | Pricing | Target | Expected Adoption |
|------|---------|--------|-------------------|
| **Community** | Free | Individual developers, open-source | 70-80% of user base |
| **Pro** | $50-100/seat/month | Small teams (2-10), startups | 15-20% |
| **Enterprise** | $50K-500K/year | Enterprises (100+), regulated industries | 5-10% |

**Projected Year 1 ARR:** $50K-100K (conservative)
**Projected Year 2 ARR:** $500K-1M

### Strategic Imperatives (Next 12 Months)

1. **January:** Community seeding (GitHub, ProductHunt, news)
2. **February:** Early adopter program (50-100 beta testers)
3. **March:** Official release (PyPI, GitHub, Docker)
4. **April-June:** Enterprise POC wins (5-10 companies)
5. **July-December:** Scaling Pro/Enterprise sales

## FAQs for Stakeholders

### Q: What's the actual market size?
**A:** The AI coding market is 3-5M developers today, growing 200%+ annually. By 2027, that's 10M+ developers. Even at 2% penetration and $50/seat/year, that's $10M TAM in year 2. With enterprise tier, it's multiples higher.

### Q: Who is the customer?
**A:** Three tiers: (1) Individual developers (free tier for organic growth), (2) Small teams with security requirements (Pro tier, $50-100/seat/month), (3) Enterprises needing compliance (Enterprise tier, $50K-500K/year).

### Q: How is this different from Copilot?
**A:** Copilot suggests code (probabilistic). Code Scalpel verifies it's safe (deterministic). We work *with* Copilot, not against it. Our positioning: "Use Copilot for fast ideas. Use Code Scalpel to prove they're safe."

### Q: What about competition from bigger players?
**A:** GitHub Copilot is textual (no code understanding). SonarQube is reactive (post-code). AWS CodeGuru is AWS-locked. We own the "deterministic verification" space. First-mover advantage + strong moat (AST/PDG expertise).

### Q: What's the revenue model?
**A:** Freemium + premium tiers. Community (free): all tools with limits. Pro ($50-100/seat): unlimited features. Enterprise (custom): compliance + dedicated support. Blended ARPU: $5-50/seat depending on mix.

### Q: What could go wrong?
**A:** (1) Copilot could copy features (unlikely - requires compiler expertise). (2) Slow enterprise adoption (mitigated by starting with small companies). (3) Technical debt from rapid development (mitigated by high test coverage).

### Q: What's the 12-month goal?
**A:** Establish Code Scalpel as the standard infrastructure for AI agent safety. Target: 1,000 GitHub stars, 5K+ monthly active users, 5-10 enterprise customers, $50-100K ARR.
