### Error Message Improvements
When files can't be found, users now see:
```
Could not resolve path 'src/utils.py'
Attempted 5 strategies:
  1. Absolute path: /workspace/src/utils.py (FAILED)
  2. Relative to workspace: /workspace/src/utils.py (FAILED)
  3. Search in project_root: /workspace/src/utils.py (FAILED)
  4. Search entire tree: (FAILED)
