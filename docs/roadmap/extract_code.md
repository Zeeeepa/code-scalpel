# extract_code Tool Roadmap

**Tool Name:** `extract_code`  
**Tool Version:** v1.0  
**Code Scalpel Version:** v3.3.0  
**Current Status:** Stable  
**Primary Module:** `src/code_scalpel/surgery/surgical_extractor.py`  
**Tier Availability:** All tiers (Community, Pro, Enterprise)

---

## Overview

The `extract_code` tool surgically extracts specific code elements (functions, classes, methods) by name.

It is designed to:
- Eliminate line-number guessing (exact symbol boundaries)
- Minimize token usage (server-side file reads)
- Provide actionable context (intra-file context + tier-limited cross-file dependencies)
- Work across languages (Python + polyglot parsing for JS/TS/Java)

---

## Polyglot Architecture Definition

**Current Status:** Partially polyglot (Python full, JS/TS/Java single-symbol; cross-file deps Python-only)

### Language Support Matrix

| Language | Community | Pro | Enterprise | Cross-File Deps | Implementation | Status |
|----------|-----------|-----|------------|-----------------|----------------|--------|
| Python | ✅ Full | ✅ Full | ✅ Full | ✅ Depth-limited | surgical_extractor | ✅ Stable |
| JavaScript | ✅ Single symbol | ✅ React metadata | ✅ React metadata | ❌ | tree-sitter + unified_extractor | ⚠️ Limited (no deps) |
| TypeScript | ✅ Single symbol | ✅ React metadata | ✅ React metadata | ❌ | tree-sitter + unified_extractor | ⚠️ Limited (no deps) |
| Java | ✅ Single symbol | ✅ Single symbol | ✅ Single symbol | ❌ | tree-sitter + unified_extractor | ⚠️ Limited (no deps) |
| Go | ❌ Not implemented | ❌ | ❌ | ❌ | N/A | 🔴 Missing |
| Rust | ❌ Not implemented | ❌ | ❌ | ❌ | N/A | 🔴 Missing |
| PHP | ❌ Not implemented | ❌ | ❌ | ❌ | N/A | 🔴 Missing |
| Ruby | ❌ Not implemented | ❌ | ❌ | ❌ | N/A | 🔴 Missing |
| Kotlin | ❌ Not implemented | ❌ | ❌ | ❌ | N/A | 🔴 Missing |

### Capability Gaps

- Cross-file dependency extraction exists **only for Python** (Pro/Enterprise); all other languages stop at single-symbol extraction
- Confidence scoring and depth clamping apply only to Python dependency paths
- React metadata exists for JS/TS but is not paired with cross-file deps
- No unified equivalence contract for dependency representation across languages

### Requirements for True Polyglot Shape

1. Implement language-specific dependency resolvers (JS/TS, Java first; then Go/Rust/PHP/Ruby/Kotlin)
2. Unify dependency schema and confidence semantics across languages
3. Support tier-gated depth clamping for all languages
4. Add cross-file tests per language with ≥95% accuracy on representative repos
5. Keep API contract stable (single entry point, same response fields) across languages

### Polyglot Completion Timeline

- **v1.1 (Q1 2026):** JS/TS + Java cross-file dependency resolution + unified schema
- **v1.2 (Q2 2026):** Add Rust/Go/PHP single-symbol extraction; add JS/TS/Java dependency accuracy hardening
- **v1.3 (Q3 2026):** Ruby/Kotlin extraction + dependency decoders; performance tuning
- **v1.4 (Q4 2026):** Polyglot validation (accuracy + perf) and confidence calibration across languages


## Current Capabilities (v1.0)

### Community Tier
- ✅ Extract functions by name
- ✅ Extract classes by name
- ✅ Extract methods from classes
- ✅ Intra-file context extraction (Python, optional via `include_context`)
- ✅ Multi-language single-symbol extraction (Python, JavaScript, TypeScript, Java)
- ⚠️ **Limits:** Cross-file dependency resolution is disabled; max dependency depth is clamped to tier limits

### Pro Tier
- ✅ All Community features
- ✅ Cross-file dependency extraction (Python only)
- ✅ Tier-limited recursion depth for dependencies (default: direct dependencies)
- ✅ Confidence scoring metadata for cross-file dependencies
- ✅ React component extraction metadata (JSX/TSX) for TypeScript/JavaScript symbols
- ✅ Decorator/annotation preservation
- ✅ Type hint preservation

### Enterprise Tier
- ✅ All Pro features
- ✅ Organization-wide resolution (monorepo / multi-repo workspace analysis)
- ✅ Custom extraction patterns (regex/import/function-call)
- ✅ Service boundary detection
- ✅ Function-to-microservice packaging (Dockerfile + API spec) via advanced options
- ⚠️ **Note:** Audit logging, policy-only extraction, and extract-and-analyze “pipelines” are roadmap items unless explicitly implemented as separate MCP tools

### Tier Contract Notes (v1.0)
- **Depth enforcement:** `context_depth` is clamped to each tier’s `max_depth` when `include_context` or `include_cross_file_deps` is enabled.
- **Cross-file scope:** Cross-file dependencies are currently implemented for **Python**; non-Python extraction uses the polyglot path and returns the extracted symbol + metadata, but does not resolve cross-file dependencies.
- **Confidence semantics:** Each external dependency is annotated with `(depth, confidence)`, where confidence decays with depth.

## Known Gaps for Polyglot Shape

### Gap #1: Cross-File Dependencies Python-Only
**Issue:** Dependency extraction + confidence scoring exist only for Python. JS/TS/Java return single-symbol without deps.

**Status:** 🔴 BLOCKING polyglot shape

**Resolution Target:** v1.1 (Q1 2026) — Add JS/TS/Java dependency resolvers with unified schema

**Acceptance Criteria:**
- JS/TS/Java support `cross_file_deps` with depth + confidence
- Tier clamping enforced for all languages
- ≥90% correctness on benchmark repos

### Gap #2: Missing Language Implementations (Go/Rust/PHP/Ruby/Kotlin)
**Issue:** Languages listed in roadmap have no extraction implementation.

**Status:** 🟡 MAJOR

**Resolution Target:** v1.2 (Q2 2026) — Add single-symbol extraction for Go/Rust/PHP; plan Ruby/Kotlin for v1.3

**Acceptance Criteria:**
- ≥95% single-symbol extraction success on curated corpus per new language
- Median extraction latency <200ms for files <1k LOC

### Gap #3: No Cross-Language Dependency Equivalence
**Issue:** Dependency payload shape and confidence semantics are not defined for non-Python languages.

**Status:** 🟡 MAJOR

**Resolution Target:** v1.1 (Q1 2026)

**Acceptance Criteria:**
- Documented schema for `cross_file_deps` across languages
- Confidence decay model applied consistently
- Tests covering multi-language dependency cases

### Gap #4: React Metadata Without Dependency Context
**Issue:** React metadata exists for JS/TS but is not linked to cross-file deps.

**Status:** 🟠 MINOR (dependent on Gap #1)

**Resolution Target:** v1.2 (Q2 2026)

**Acceptance Criteria:**
- React components include cross-file deps for hooks/utilities
- Metadata and deps share consistent confidence scoring

## Roadmap

## Cross-Cutting Research Topics (applies across v1.1–v1.4)

### RQ1 — Symbol Boundary Accuracy
- How often does extraction return the *exact* intended symbol (decorators, docstrings, nested defs, overloads)?
- What are the top failure modes by language and symbol type?

### RQ2 — Dependency Relevance vs. Token Budget
- Which dependency selection strategies maximize “useful context per token”?
- Can we automatically cap context while preserving compilation/runtime correctness?

### RQ3 — Import & Module Resolution Correctness
- Which import styles cause the most misses (relative imports, re-exports, star imports, namespace packages)?
- How do we detect and annotate unresolved imports without hallucinating?

### RQ4 — Confidence Scoring Calibration
- Does a depth-based decay model correlate with actual correctness?
- What threshold(s) best predict “safe to trust” vs. “needs verification”?

### RQ5 — Tier-Limited Behavior UX
- Do users understand clamping/truncation warnings without upsell messaging?
- What wording reduces confusion while preserving security and tier constraints?

**Pro Success Metrics**
- ≥80% of returned examples are judged “useful” in blinded human review

#### Enterprise Tier
- [ ] Extract with security context
- [ ] Extract with compliance metadata
- [ ] Custom post-extraction hooks

## Known Issues & Limitations

### Current Limitations
- **Dynamic symbols:** Cannot extract dynamically generated functions
- **Complex generics:** Some complex TypeScript generics may not preserve fully
- **Cross-file deps (polyglot):** Cross-file dependency resolution is currently Python-only
- **Macro-generated code:** Future C/C++ support will need macro strategy

### Planned Fixes
- v1.1: Improved generic handling
- v1.2: Partial macro support
- v1.3: Dynamic symbol inference (best effort)

---

## Success Metrics

### Performance Targets
- **Extraction time:** <50ms for single symbol
- **Accuracy:** >99% correct symbol extraction
- **Dependency resolution:** >95% accuracy

### Reliability Targets
- **Tier clamp correctness:** 100% of requests honor configured `max_depth` (unit tests + fuzz)
- **Confidence calibration:** ≥0.7 AUC for predicting correct dependency resolution (benchmark set)

### Adoption Metrics
- **Usage:** 500K+ extractions per month by Q4 2026
- **Error rate:** <1% failed extractions

---
