## Roadmap

### Cross-Cutting Research Topics

**Research queries (cross-cutting):**
- How do we guarantee deterministic findings across OS/Node/Python versions for external linters (e.g., normalize/lock ESLint + plugins; normalize pycodestyle output)?
- What is the right intermediate representation for multi-language rules: regex-only, AST-only, or a hybrid IR that can map to Python `ast`, JS/TS parsers, and Java parsers?
- What are measurable false-positive/false-negative budgets per rule class (style, smells, security, compliance), and how do we build a benchmark suite to enforce them in CI?
- How should “suppression” work (inline ignores vs policy allowlists vs baselines) without weakening governance/auditability?
- What policy schema versioning strategy prevents breaking changes while enabling richer rules (dependencies, semantic matching, context windows)?

**Research topics (cross-cutting):**
- Evaluation harness: golden fixtures per language, regression scoring, and release gates
- Confidence + “best-effort” semantics: when to omit results vs return partials
- Determinism guarantees: stable outputs across platforms, tool versions, and parallelism
- Policy governance: ownership, change control, review workflows, and tamper resistance (tie-in with `verify_policy_integrity`)
- Performance envelopes: timeouts, incremental scanning, and predictable scaling on large repos

**Success metrics (cross-cutting):**
- Determinism: stable ordering and consistent findings for the same inputs in the supported environment matrix
- Contract stability: backward-compatible policy schema changes only; compatibility checks in CI
- Quality: tracked FP/FN budgets per rule category with regression alerts
- Governance: auditable policy + execution metadata with defined retention and access boundaries

### v1.1 (Q1 2026): Enhanced Rule Engine

#### Community Tier
- [ ] TypeScript style checking
- [ ] Java style checking
- [ ] Configurable severity levels

**Research topics (Q1 / Community):**
- TypeScript linting architecture: ESLint + `@typescript-eslint` vs TypeScript compiler API checks (tradeoffs: fidelity, speed, determinism)
- Java linting architecture: Checkstyle vs SpotBugs vs Error Prone integration model and output normalization
- Severity mapping: policy-driven severity overrides, default severity per rule, and consistent ranking across languages

**Success metrics (Q1 / Community):**
- Language support: TS/Java checks produce actionable spans/line numbers for the majority of findings
- Severity: severity overrides are deterministic and consistently applied across rule sources

#### Pro Tier
- [ ] Semantic rule matching
- [ ] Context-aware rules
- [ ] Rule dependency management
- [ ] Policy testing framework

**Research topics (Q1 / Pro):**
- Semantic matching: rule targets as AST patterns (e.g., “calls to X with tainted arg”) vs structural patterns (tree/graph query language)
- Context windows: surrounding lines/AST parents for rules like “log PHI” or “SQL concat” to reduce false positives
- Rule dependencies: defining prerequisites and composing rules (e.g., taint sources/sinks feeding higher-level findings)
- Policy testing: fixture format, expected findings schema, and “golden test” authoring UX for policy owners

**Success metrics (Q1 / Pro):**
- Semantic rules: measurable FP reduction vs regex-only baselines on benchmark suite
- Policy tests: policy owners can add a new policy + fixture and get deterministic pass/fail in CI

#### Enterprise Tier
- [ ] Policy simulation mode
- [ ] Impact analysis for policy changes
- [ ] Policy versioning and rollback

**Research topics (Q1 / Enterprise):**
- Simulation mode: dry-run outputs that include a delta report vs prior baseline (without mutating audit trails unless explicitly requested)
- Impact analysis: estimating “new violations introduced” vs “existing violations reclassified” when policies change
- Versioning/rollback: policy provenance, signed versions, and safe rollback mechanics with auditability

**Success metrics (Q1 / Enterprise):**
- Impact analysis: accurate delta summaries with stable categorization and low-noise diffs
- Versioning: rollback is fast, traceable, and does not break policy schema compatibility

### v1.2 (Q2 2026): Compliance Expansion

#### Pro Tier
- [ ] OWASP Top 10 mapping
- [ ] CWE compliance checking
- [ ] Security best practices

**Research topics (Q2 / Pro):**
- OWASP mapping granularity: rule-to-OWASP category vs finding-to-category; handling multi-mapped findings
- CWE mapping: canonical CWE IDs for patterns and how to avoid incorrect/overbroad labeling
- Security best practices: defining “best practice” rules with measurable value and bounded false positives

**Success metrics (Q2 / Pro):**
- Mapping accuracy: high agreement between curated ground truth and tool mappings on benchmark suite
- Signal quality: security rule set meets FP/FN budgets and produces actionable remediation guidance

#### Enterprise Tier
- [ ] GDPR compliance rules
- [ ] CCPA compliance rules
- [ ] Industry-specific regulations
- [ ] Custom compliance frameworks

**Research topics (Q2 / Enterprise):**
- Compliance rule authoring model: reusable controls, inheritance, and evidence requirements per standard
- “Custom compliance frameworks”: schema for user-defined standards, scoring, and certification outputs
- Regulatory drift: how to keep standard mappings updated and versioned without breaking reproducibility

**Success metrics (Q2 / Enterprise):**
- Custom frameworks: users can define a standard + controls and generate a consistent report/certification artifact
- Reproducibility: compliance reports are reproducible for a fixed policy version + code snapshot

### v1.3 (Q3 2026): AI-Enhanced Policy Checking

#### Pro Tier
- [ ] ML-based pattern recognition
- [ ] Anomaly-based policy violations
- [ ] Intelligent false positive reduction

**Research topics (Q3 / Pro):**
- ML scope: where ML is appropriate (ranking/triage) vs where deterministic rules are required (compliance/audit)
- False-positive reduction: human-in-the-loop feedback loops with privacy-safe telemetry
- Anomaly detection: defining baselines per repo/org and preventing “learning bad patterns” as normal

**Success metrics (Q3 / Pro):**
- ML assist: reduces triage time / improves ranking without increasing missed critical findings
- Calibration: confidence scores correlate with true-positive likelihood on held-out evaluation sets

#### Enterprise Tier
- [ ] Custom ML model training
- [ ] Organizational pattern learning
- [ ] Predictive policy violations

**Research topics (Q3 / Enterprise):**
- Model governance: auditability, drift detection, and reproducible training datasets
- Org learning: isolating tenant data; privacy boundaries; opt-in and retention controls
- Predictive findings: how to present predictions with calibrated confidence to avoid over-claiming

**Success metrics (Q3 / Enterprise):**
- Governance: training + inference workflows produce auditable artifacts and reproducible evaluations
- Predictive: precision/recall tracked against post-merge outcomes with calibrated uncertainty

### v1.4 (Q4 2026): Integration & Automation

#### Community Tier
- [ ] GitHub Actions integration
- [ ] Pre-commit hooks
- [ ] CI/CD pipeline support

**Research topics (Q4 / Community):**
- CI ergonomics: fast fail vs full report, caching, and baseline-only modes for incremental adoption
- Developer UX: pre-commit latency budgets and clear actionable output formatting

**Success metrics (Q4 / Community):**
- CI adoption: reference workflows run in predictable time with stable outputs and minimal flakes

#### Pro Tier
- [ ] IDE real-time checking
- [ ] Automated fix suggestions
- [ ] Policy violation dashboard

**Research topics (Q4 / Pro):**
- Real-time checking: incremental scanning and diagnostics streaming without leaking source
- Fix suggestions: safety model, confidence scoring, and opt-in auto-fix vs suggested patch outputs
- Dashboard: aggregation model, deduplication, and trend tracking without inflating noise

**Success metrics (Q4 / Pro):**
- Fixes: suggested fixes are accurate and low-regression on benchmark suite
- Dashboard: actionable trends with low duplication and stable severity ranking

#### Enterprise Tier
- [ ] ServiceNow integration
- [ ] Jira compliance tickets
- [ ] Custom webhook notifications
- [ ] SIEM integration

**Research topics (Q4 / Enterprise):**
- Ticketing integrations: mapping findings to issue schemas, deduplication, and lifecycle management
- SIEM integration: event schemas, rate limiting, redaction, and safe transport guarantees
- Webhooks: secure signing, retries, and idempotency guarantees

**Success metrics (Q4 / Enterprise):**
- Integrations: reliable delivery with idempotency; no duplicate storms; clear operational runbooks
