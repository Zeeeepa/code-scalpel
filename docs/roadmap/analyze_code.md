# analyze_code Tool Roadmap

**Tool Name:** `analyze_code`  
**Tool Version:** v1.0  
**Code Scalpel Version:** v3.3  
**Current Status:** ✅ **Stable** - Pre-release validation completed  
**Test Coverage:** 107 tests passing (100% pass rate)  
**Primary Module (MCP Tool Implementation):** `src/code_scalpel/mcp/server.py` (`_analyze_code_sync`)  
**Related Module (Python-only deeper analysis pipeline):** `src/code_scalpel/analysis/code_analyzer.py`  
**Tier Availability:** All tiers (Community, Pro, Enterprise)

---

## Overview

The `analyze_code` MCP tool provides static (non-executing) code structure analysis.

What it does today (v3.3):
- Supports **Python** via `ast`.
- Supports **JavaScript/TypeScript** via `tree-sitter`.
- Supports **Java** via a dedicated analyzer.

It extracts functions/classes/imports, computes a basic complexity score, and returns basic heuristics ("issues"). It does **not** run a full vulnerability scan; use `security_scan` for that.

---

## Polyglot Architecture Definition

**Current Status:** Partially polyglot (4 languages, Python-heavy enrichments)

### Language Support Matrix

The tool supports 4 languages but with vastly different enrichment capabilities:

| Language | Community | Pro | Enterprise | Implementation | Status |
|----------|-----------|-----|------------|---|---|
| Python | ✅ Full | ✅ Full | ✅ Full | ast stdlib | ✅ Stable |
| JavaScript | ✅ Basic | ⚠️ Limited | ⚠️ Limited | tree-sitter | ✅ Working |
| TypeScript | ✅ Basic | ⚠️ Limited | ⚠️ Limited | tree-sitter | ✅ Working |
| Java | ✅ Basic | ⚠️ Limited | ⚠️ Limited | tree-sitter | ✅ Working |
| **Go** | ❌ **Not implemented** | ❌ | ❌ | Config only | 🔴 **Advertised but missing** |
| **Rust** | ❌ **Not implemented** | ❌ | ❌ | Config only | 🔴 **Advertised but missing** |

### Enrichment Capability Matrix (The Real Polyglot Gap)

While basic structure extraction (functions, classes, imports) works across all 4 supported languages, **enrichments are predominantly Python-only**:

| Enrichment | Python | Java | JS/TS | Status | Notes |
|---|---|---|---|---|---|
| Functions/Classes | ✅ | ✅ | ✅ | Stable | Unified format |
| Imports | ✅ | ✅ | ✅ | Stable | Unified format |
| Cyclomatic Complexity | ✅ | ⚠️ | ⚠️ | Partial | Basic for non-Python |
| **Cognitive Complexity** | ✅ Pro | ❌ | ❌ | **Python-only** | Sonar metric |
| **Code Smells** | ✅ Pro | ❌ | ❌ | **Python-only** | 7+ patterns |
| **Halstead Metrics** | ✅ Pro | ❌ | ❌ | **Python-only** | n1, n2, N1, N2, volume, effort |
| **Duplicate Detection** | ✅ Pro | ❌ | ❌ | **Python-only** | Sliding window analysis |
| **Dependency Graph** | ✅ Pro | ❌ | ❌ | **Python-only** | Call graph |
| Framework Detection | ✅ | ✅ | ✅ | Best-effort | Heuristic-based |
| **Dead Code Hints** | ✅ Pro | ❌ | ❌ | **Python-only** | Unused imports, unreachable |
| **Decorator Summary** | ✅ Pro | ❌ | ❌ | **Python-only** | Annotation inventory |
| Type Summary | ✅ Pro | ❌ | ✅ | Partial | Basic for TS |
| **Naming Conventions** | ✅ Enterprise | ❌ | ❌ | **Python-only** | PEP8 validation |
| **Compliance Checks** | ✅ Enterprise | ❌ | ❌ | **Python-only** | Bare except, plaintext passwords |
| **Custom Rules** | ✅ Enterprise | ❌ | ❌ | **Python-only** | User-supplied patterns |
| **Architecture Patterns** | ✅ Enterprise | ❌ | ❌ | **Python-only** | Service, controller detection |
| **Technical Debt** | ✅ Enterprise | ❌ | ❌ | **Python-only** | Effort estimation |
| **API Surface** | ✅ Enterprise | ✅ | ✅ | Best-effort | Public symbols inventory |

### Current Limitation: Not True Polyglot

The tool is **partially polyglot** because:

1. **Advertised-but-missing languages:** Config advertises Go/Rust but MCP implementation routes only Python/JavaScript/TypeScript/Java
2. **Enrichment asymmetry:** Pro/Enterprise tiers are Python-centric; non-Python languages get basic structure extraction only
3. **No unified contract:** No definition of what "code smell" means in Java vs Python; no cross-language complexity equivalence
4. **Language-specific heuristics:** Cognitive complexity, code smells, naming violations use Python AST patterns not portable to other languages

### Requirements for True Polyglot Shape

To achieve polyglot shape, the tool must:

1. **Resolve advertised languages:** Either implement Go/Rust analyzers or remove from documentation
2. **Unify enrichment interface:** Define `LanguageAnalyzer` interface all languages implement:
   ```python
   class LanguageAnalyzer(ABC):
       def extract_structure(self, code: str) -> StructureInfo: ...
       def calculate_cognitive_complexity(self, code: str) -> int: ...
       def detect_code_smells(self, code: str) -> List[CodeSmell]: ...
       def detect_naming_violations(self, code: str) -> List[str]: ...
       def build_dependency_graph(self, code: str) -> Dict[str, List[str]]: ...
   ```
3. **Port enrichments:** Implement language-specific equivalents of cognitive complexity, code smells, dependency graphs, dead code detection
4. **Define equivalence:** Document what enrichments mean per language (e.g., "cognitive complexity" in Python = cyclomatic + nesting in Java)
5. **Tier consistency:** All languages provide same tier-gated enrichments (not Python-only)
6. **Validation:** Unified test suite proving all languages produce comparable outputs

### Polyglot Completion Timeline

- **v1.1 (Q1 2026):** Resolve Go/Rust gap + unify core enrichments for Python/Java/JS/TS
- **v1.2 (Q2 2026):** Add Go, Rust, Ruby support with full enrichment parity
- **v1.3 (Q3 2026):** Performance optimization and polyglot validation
- **Tool is polyglot:** When all 7 languages provide equivalent enrichments at all tiers

---

## Known Gaps for Polyglot Shape

### Gap #1: Advertised But Not Implemented

**Issue:** ~~Config files advertise Go/Rust support, but MCP handler only routes Python/JavaScript/TypeScript/Java~~

**Status:** ✅ **RESOLVED** (v1.0 pre-release validation, 2026-01-10)

**Resolution Applied:**
- Removed Go/Rust from `.code-scalpel/limits.toml` Pro tier configuration
- Added explicit language validation in `_analyze_code_sync()` to reject unsupported languages with helpful error message
- Added 5 tests validating language rejection behavior and error messages
- Error message now states: "Unsupported language 'X'. Supported: java, javascript, python, typescript. Roadmap: Go/Rust in Q1 2026."

**Acceptance Criteria:**
- ✅ Routing and documentation agree on supported languages (Python, JavaScript, TypeScript, Java only)
- ✅ No advertised but unimplemented languages in configuration
- ✅ Explicit validation prevents silent fallback with incorrect results
- ✅ Configuration alignment validated by automated tests

### Gap #2: Enrichments Are Python-Only

**Issue:** Cognitive complexity, code smells, halstead metrics, dead code hints, naming violations, compliance checks, custom rules, architecture patterns, and technical debt scoring are **all Python-exclusive**

**Status:** 🟡 MAJOR - Prevents true polyglot shape

**Current State:**
- Python: 17+ enrichments across all tiers
- Java/JS/TS: Basic structure extraction only

**Resolution:** v1.2 (Q2 2026) - Port all enrichments to Java, JavaScript, TypeScript
- Implement language-specific code smell detectors
- Implement language-specific cognitive complexity metrics
- Implement language-specific dead code detection
- Implement language-specific naming convention validators

**Acceptance Criteria:**
- All 4 supported languages have ≥90% of enrichments implemented
- Tier-gating applied consistently across languages
- No enrichments marked as Python-only

### Gap #3: No Unified Contract Across Languages

**Issue:** No definition of "equivalence" for enrichments across languages

**Example:** What does "cognitive complexity = 8" mean in Python vs Java? Are they comparable?

**Status:** 🟡 MAJOR - Prevents meaningful comparison

**Resolution:** v1.1 (Q1 2026) - Document cross-language enrichment equivalence

**Acceptance Criteria:**
- Language-independent definitions for each enrichment metric
- Justification for why metrics are/aren't comparable across languages
- Guidance for users interpreting scores across languages

---

## Current Capabilities (v1.0)

### ✅ Pre-Release Validation Completed (2026-01-10)

**Test Coverage:** 107 tests passing (100% pass rate, 2.56s execution)
- 94 existing tests: Core functionality, edge cases, tiers, limits
- 13 new validation tests: Language validation, output metadata, configuration alignment

**Improvements Applied:**
1. **Language Validation**: Explicit rejection of unsupported languages (Go/Rust) with roadmap guidance
2. **Output Metadata**: Added `language_detected` and `tier_applied` fields for transparency
3. **Configuration Alignment**: Removed advertised-but-not-implemented languages from limits.toml
4. **Error UX**: Clear error messages listing supported languages and roadmap timing

**Validated Behavior:**
- ✅ Multi-language parsing (Python, JavaScript, TypeScript, Java)
- ✅ Tier-based feature gating (Community, Pro, Enterprise)
- ✅ Zero hallucination via real parsers (ast, tree-sitter, dedicated analyzers)
- ✅ Graceful error handling with helpful messages
- ✅ Configuration and implementation alignment

	- Decorator summary (as `decorator_summary`) (Python best-effort)
	- Type/generic usage summary (as `type_summary`) (Python best-effort)
- Configured limits (see `.code-scalpel/limits.toml`):

	- Priority ordering marker (as `prioritized`) (best-effort)
	- Complexity trends (as `complexity_trends`, requires `file_path`) (best-effort, in-memory per server process)
- Configured limits (see `.code-scalpel/limits.toml`):
	- `max_file_size_mb = 100`
	- `languages` is “unlimited by omission” in config, but the MCP `analyze_code` implementation currently only routes `python/javascript/typescript/java`.

## Roadmap

### Cross-Cutting Research Topics

**Research topics (cross-cutting):**
- Evaluation harness: golden fixtures per language, regression scoring, and release gates
- False-positive/false-negative budgets per feature class (smells, dead code hints, patterns)
- Confidence scoring and “best-effort” semantics: when to omit fields vs return partials
- Determinism guarantees: stable outputs across platforms, parser versions, and parallelism
- Security and privacy boundaries: ensure analysis artifacts do not leak source or secrets
- Schema/versioning strategy: adding fields safely, deprecations, and compatibility tests

**Success metrics (cross-cutting):**
- Determinism: identical outputs for the same input across OS/CPU within supported matrix
- Contract stability: backward-compatible schema changes only; automated compatibility checks in CI
- Quality gates: measurable FP/FN budgets per feature category with tracked regressions
- Security hygiene: zero known secret exfiltration paths in generated artifacts; routine scanning in CI

### Q1 2026: Resolve Polyglot Gaps & Enhanced Language Support

#### Blocker Items (Must Complete First)
- [ ] **POLYGLOT GAP #1:** Reconcile `.code-scalpel/limits.toml` language lists with MCP routing
  - **Acceptance:** Routing and docs agree on supported languages (remove Go/Rust or implement)
  - **Effort:** 3 hours
  - **Blocker:** Must resolve before adding new languages

#### Community Tier
- [ ] Add Rust AST parsing support (only if Gap #1 resolution includes Rust)
- [ ] Add PHP AST parsing support
- [ ] Improve TypeScript generic handling
- [ ] Enhanced error messages for parsing failures

**Research topics (Q1 / Community):**

- PHP parsing options (tree-sitter-php vs nikic/php-parser) and error recovery behavior
- TypeScript generic/type extraction quality using the TypeScript compiler API vs tree-sitter heuristics
- Parser error UX: actionable diagnostics, snippet localization, and recovery strategies

**Success metrics (Q1 / Community):**
- New languages: function/class extraction accuracy meets or exceeds existing Community baselines
- Error UX: parse failures include actionable reason + localized span for the majority of failures
- Limits alignment: config and routing agree (no "advertised but unsupported" languages)
