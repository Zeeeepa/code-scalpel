# Code Scalpel Development Roadmap

**Document Version:** 10.0 (v3.1.0 "Parser Unification" Complete)  
**Last Updated:** December 21, 2025  <!-- [20251221_DOCS] v10.0 roadmap - v3.1.0 Parser Unification complete, polyglot write roadmap -->
**Current Release:** v3.1.0 "Parser Unification" (Released Dec 21, 2025)
**Next Release:** v3.2.0 "Polyglot Pro" (Multi-Language Write Operations & Security)

## The Surgical Suite Vision

> **"Vibe coding with executive function."**

Every AI coding interaction—whether Claude, Copilot, Cursor, or any future agent—operates through Code Scalpel's **Surgical Suite**. The developer experience feels like natural "vibe coding," but every action is:
- **Auditable** - Immutable record of what changed, why, and who approved
- **Governed** - Policy enforcement before any file modification
- **Surgical** - Precise, minimal changes with blast radius controls
- **Verified** - Proof that changes are safe before they ship

## Revolutionary Assessment: The v3.0.0 Vision

### Why "Revolutionary"?

Upon successful completion of v3.0.0 "Autonomy", Code Scalpel will represent a **paradigm shift** in AI-assisted development:

| Traditional AI Coding | Code Scalpel Revolution |
|-----------------------|------------------------|
| AI **guesses** where code is | AI **knows** where code is (AST-based) |
| AI **assumes** changes are safe | AI **proves** changes are safe |
| AI **hopes** it understood context | AI **verifies** context with confidence scores |
| Trust AI by default | Trust is **earned through restraint** |
| Single-language analysis | **Unified Graph** across all languages |
| No governance controls | **Policy-as-Code** enforcement |
| Manual error fixing | **Self-correction** with fix hints |
| Unverified outputs | **Full audit trail** for every decision |

### The Four Pillars of Revolution

1. **Unified System Intelligence** (v2.2.0 "Nexus")
   - Single graph across Python, JavaScript, TypeScript, Java
   - Confidence scoring that admits uncertainty ("I don't know")
   - Cross-language contract breach detection

2. **Trust Through Restraint** (v2.5.0 "Guardian")
   - Policy-as-code enforcement (OPA/Rego)
   - Change budgeting and blast radius control
   - 100% OWASP Top 10 block rate
   - Tamper-resistant analysis

3. **Self-Correction Under Supervision** (v3.0.0 "Autonomy")
   - Error-to-diff with actionable hints
   - Speculative execution in sandbox
   - Ecosystem lock-in with major frameworks

4. **Zero-Hallucination Guarantee** (All Versions)
   - Never presents guesses as facts
   - Human-in-the-loop for low-confidence decisions
   - Full audit trail for every decision

### Revolutionary Nomenclature Justification

**The "Revolutionary" label is earned, not claimed:**

- **Industry First:** No existing tool provides cross-language unified graphs with explicit confidence scoring
- **Paradigm Shift:** Moves from "AI suggests code" to "AI proves changes are safe"
- **Trust Model Inversion:** Instead of trusting AI by default, trust is earned through verified restraint
- **Ecosystem Standard:** Goal of becoming the required dependency for production-grade AI agents

**Post-v3.0.0 Declaration:** "Unverified Agents are Legacy Software"

## Adversarial Testing Methodology

<!-- [20251216_DOCS] Comprehensive adversarial testing framework -->

> **Role:** Skeptical Senior Engineer / Security Red Team  
> **Objective:** Break the claims of Code Scalpel at every release  
> **Principle:** "An agent that works in Java but breaks the Frontend is useless. An agent that guesses is dangerous."

### Adversarial Philosophy

Code Scalpel employs a **"Red Team Before Release"** approach where every feature must be subjected to adversarial testing before shipping. This ensures:

1. **Claims are Provable:** Every marketing claim has a corresponding test
2. **Failures are Documented:** Known limitations are explicit, not hidden
3. **Regressions are Blocked:** Previous capabilities never silently break
4. **Trust is Earned:** Confidence scores admit uncertainty instead of guessing

### Testing Categories

| Category | Purpose | Fail Condition |
|----------|---------|----------------|
| **Regression Baseline** | Ensure previous features still work | Any regression = Stop Ship |
| **Explicit Uncertainty** | Verify confidence scoring works | Silent hallucination |
| **Cross-Boundary** | Verify multi-language linking | False connections |
| **Enforcement** | Verify policy blocking works | Policy bypass |
| **Tamper Resistance** | Verify agent cannot circumvent | Successful bypass |
| **Feedback Quality** | Verify fix hints are valid | Invalid hint presented |
| **Simulation** | Verify sandbox isolation | Side effect leakage |

### Proof Requirements by Release

| Release | Required Proofs | Evidence Files |
|---------|-----------------|----------------|
| v2.2.0 | Confidence scores, HTTP linking, Type syncing, Zero hallucinations | `v2.2.0_graph_evidence.json` |
| v2.5.0 | Semantic blocking, OWASP 100% block, Tamper resistance | `v2.5.0_policy_evidence.json` |
| v3.0.0 | Fix accuracy >50%, Sandbox isolation, Loop termination | `v3.0.0_autonomy_evidence.json` |

### Running Adversarial Tests

```bash
# Full adversarial suite

## Executive Summary

Code Scalpel is an **MCP server toolkit designed for AI agents** (Claude, GitHub Copilot, Cursor, etc.) to perform surgical code operations without hallucination risk. By providing AI assistants with precise, AST-based code analysis and modification tools, we eliminate the guesswork that leads to broken code, incorrect line numbers, and context loss.

### Core Mission

**Enable AI agents to work on real codebases with surgical precision.**

Traditional AI coding assistants struggle with:
- **Hallucinated line numbers** - AI guesses where code is located
- **Context overflow** - Large files exceed token limits, AI loses track
- **Blind modifications** - AI rewrites entire functions when only one line needs changing
- **No verification** - AI cannot confirm its changes preserve behavior

Code Scalpel solves these by giving AI agents MCP tools that:
- **Extract exactly what's needed** - Surgical extraction of functions/classes by name, not line guessing
- **Modify without collateral damage** - Replace specific symbols, preserving surrounding code
- **Verify before applying** - Simulate refactors to detect behavior changes
- **Analyze with certainty** - Real AST parsing, not regex pattern matching

| **P1**   | Improve test generation types           | TDE   | 2 days | None         |

### Technical Specifications

#### 1. Fix `extract_code` File Path Resolution

**Problem:** External testers reported `"File not found: test_code_scalpel_security.py"` when using relative paths.

**Root Cause:** The `extract_code` tool doesn't resolve paths relative to the workspace root.

**Solution:**

```python
# In src/code_scalpel/mcp/server.py or surgical tools

def resolve_file_path(file_path: str, workspace_root: str = None) -> str:
    """Resolve file path to absolute path."""
    path = Path(file_path)

    # Already absolute
    if path.is_absolute():
        return str(path)

    # Try relative to workspace root
    if workspace_root:
        workspace_path = Path(workspace_root) / path
        if workspace_path.exists():
            return str(workspace_path)

    # Try relative to current working directory
    cwd_path = Path.cwd() / path
    if cwd_path.exists():
        return str(cwd_path)

    # Try common project structures
    for prefix in ["src", "lib", "app", "."]:
        candidate = Path(prefix) / path
        if candidate.exists():
            return str(candidate.resolve())

    raise FileNotFoundError(f"Cannot resolve path: {file_path}")
```

**Acceptance Criteria:**

- [x] `extract_code("utils.py", ...)` works from project root
- [x] `extract_code("src/utils.py", ...)` works with relative paths
- [x] `extract_code("/absolute/path/utils.py", ...)` works unchanged
- [x] Clear error message when file truly doesn't exist

#### 2. Hardcoded Secret Detection

**New Vulnerability Type:** `HARDCODED_SECRET` (CWE-798)

**Patterns to Detect:**

```python
# src/code_scalpel/symbolic_execution_tools/taint_tracker.py

HARDCODED_SECRET_PATTERNS = {
    "aws_access_key": r"(?i)AKIA[A-Z0-9]{16}",
    "aws_secret_key": r"(?i)aws[_-]?secret[_-]?access[_-]?key\s*[=:]\s*['\"][A-Za-z0-9/+=]{40}['\"]",
    "github_token": r"ghp_[a-zA-Z0-9]{36}",
    "github_oauth": r"gho_[a-zA-Z0-9]{36}",
    "github_app": r"ghu_[a-zA-Z0-9]{36}",
    "gitlab_token": r"glpat-[a-zA-Z0-9\-]{20,}",
    "stripe_live": r"sk_live_[a-zA-Z0-9]{24,}",
    "stripe_test": r"sk_test_[a-zA-Z0-9]{24,}",
    "slack_token": r"xox[baprs]-[a-zA-Z0-9\-]{10,}",
    "slack_webhook": r"https://hooks\.slack\.com/services/T[A-Z0-9]+/B[A-Z0-9]+/[a-zA-Z0-9]+",
    "google_api": r"AIza[0-9A-Za-z\-_]{35}",
    "firebase": r"AAAA[A-Za-z0-9_-]{7}:[A-Za-z0-9_-]{140}",
    "twilio_sid": r"AC[a-z0-9]{32}",
    "twilio_token": r"SK[a-z0-9]{32}",
    "sendgrid": r"SG\.[a-zA-Z0-9\-_]{22}\.[a-zA-Z0-9\-_]{43}",
    "private_key": r"-----BEGIN\s+(RSA\s+|EC\s+|DSA\s+|OPENSSH\s+)?PRIVATE\s+KEY-----",
    "generic_secret": r"(?i)(secret|password|passwd|pwd|token|api[_-]?key)\s*[=:]\s*['\"][^'\"]{8,}['\"]",
}
```

**Implementation:**

```python
# Add to SecuritySink enum
class SecuritySink(Enum):
    # ... existing sinks ...
    HARDCODED_SECRET = "hardcoded_secret"

# Add detection in security_analyzer.py
def _check_hardcoded_secrets(self, node: ast.AST) -> List[Vulnerability]:
    """Check for hardcoded secrets in string literals."""
    vulnerabilities = []

    for child in ast.walk(node):
        if isinstance(child, ast.Constant) and isinstance(child.value, str):
            for secret_type, pattern in HARDCODED_SECRET_PATTERNS.items():
                if re.search(pattern, child.value):
                    vulnerabilities.append(Vulnerability(
                        type="Hardcoded Secret",
                        cwe="CWE-798",
                        severity="HIGH",
                        message=f"Hardcoded {secret_type} detected",
                        line=child.lineno,
                        column=child.col_offset,
                    ))

    return vulnerabilities
```

**Test Cases:**

```python
def test_detects_aws_access_key():
    code = 'AWS_ACCESS_KEY = "AKIAIOSFODNN7EXAMPLE"'
    result = security_scan(code)
    assert len(result.vulnerabilities) == 1
    assert "aws_access_key" in result.vulnerabilities[0].message.lower()

def test_detects_github_token():
    code = 'GITHUB_TOKEN = "ghp_xxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxx"'
    result = security_scan(code)
    assert len(result.vulnerabilities) == 1

def test_ignores_placeholder():
    code = 'API_KEY = "your-api-key-here"'  # Placeholder, not real
    result = security_scan(code)
    assert len(result.vulnerabilities) == 0  # Or flag as "potential"
```

#### 3. NoSQL Injection (MongoDB)

**New Sink Category:** MongoDB query methods

**Patterns:**

```python
# Add to SINK_PATTERNS in taint_tracker.py

"nosql_injection": [
    # PyMongo
    "collection.find",
    "collection.find_one",
    "collection.find_one_and_delete",
    "collection.find_one_and_replace",
    "collection.find_one_and_update",
    "collection.aggregate",
    "collection.count_documents",
    "collection.distinct",
    "collection.update_one",
    "collection.update_many",
    "collection.delete_one",
    "collection.delete_many",
    "collection.insert_one",
    "collection.insert_many",
    "collection.replace_one",
    "db.command",
    # Motor (async)
    "motor_collection.find",
    "motor_collection.find_one",
    "motor_collection.aggregate",
    # MongoEngine
    "Document.objects",
    "QuerySet.filter",
    "QuerySet.get",
],
```

**Vulnerable Pattern Example:**

```python
# VULNERABLE - user input directly in query
@app.route('/user/<user_id>')
def get_user(user_id):
    # NoSQL injection: {"$gt": ""} returns all users
    user = db.users.find_one({"_id": user_id})  # SINK
    return jsonify(user)

# SAFE - validated ObjectId
from bson import ObjectId
@app.route('/user/<user_id>')
def get_user_safe(user_id):
    try:
        oid = ObjectId(user_id)  # Validates format
        user = db.users.find_one({"_id": oid})
        return jsonify(user)
    except:
        return "Invalid ID", 400
```

#### 4. LDAP Injection

**New Sink Category:** LDAP query methods

**Patterns:**

```python
# Add to SINK_PATTERNS in taint_tracker.py

"ldap_injection": [
    # python-ldap
    "ldap.search",
    "ldap.search_s",
    "ldap.search_st",
    "ldap.search_ext",
    "ldap.search_ext_s",
    "ldap.bind",
    "ldap.bind_s",
    "ldap.simple_bind",
    "ldap.simple_bind_s",
    "ldap.modify",
    "ldap.modify_s",
    "ldap.add",
    "ldap.add_s",
    "ldap.delete",
    "ldap.delete_s",
    # ldap3
    "Connection.search",
    "Connection.bind",
    "Connection.modify",
    "Connection.add",
    "Connection.delete",
],
```

**Vulnerable Pattern Example:**

```python
# VULNERABLE - user input in LDAP filter
def authenticate(username, password):
    ldap_filter = f"(&(uid={username})(userPassword={password}))"  # INJECTION!
    conn.search("dc=example,dc=com", ldap_filter)

# SAFE - escaped input
from ldap3.utils.conv import escape_filter_chars
def authenticate_safe(username, password):
    safe_user = escape_filter_chars(username)
    safe_pass = escape_filter_chars(password)
    ldap_filter = f"(&(uid={safe_user})(userPassword={safe_pass}))"
    conn.search("dc=example,dc=com", ldap_filter)
```

## v1.4.0 - "Context" RELEASED

### Overview

**Theme:** Enhanced AI Context and Detection Coverage  
**Goal:** Give AI agents richer context about code and expand vulnerability detection  
**Effort:** ~12 developer-days  
**Risk Level:** Low (extends existing MCP tools)  
**Status:** Released December 12, 2025

### Priorities

| Priority | Feature | Owner | Effort | Status |
|----------|---------|-------|--------|--------|
| **P0** | `get_file_context` MCP tool | TDE | 3 days | DONE |
| **P0** | `get_symbol_references` MCP tool | TDE | 2 days | DONE |
| **P0** | XXE detection (CWE-611) | TDE | 2 days | DONE |
| **P0** | SSTI detection (CWE-1336) | TDE | 1 day | DONE |
| **P1** | JWT vulnerabilities | - | 2 days | Deferred to v1.5.0 |
| **P1** | Mass assignment detection | - | 2 days | Deferred to v1.5.0 |

### Technical Specifications

#### 1. `get_file_context` MCP Tool

**Purpose:** AI agents need to understand a file's role without reading the entire file.

```python
# New MCP tool for AI agents
async def get_file_context(file_path: str) -> FileContext:
    """Provide AI with file overview without full content."""
    return FileContext(
        file_path=file_path,
        language="python",
        line_count=450,
        functions=["main", "process_request", "validate_input"],
        classes=["RequestHandler", "Validator"],
        imports=["flask", "sqlalchemy", "os"],
        exports=["RequestHandler", "main"],
        complexity_score=12,
        has_security_issues=True,
        summary="Flask request handler with database operations"
    )
```

**Why AI Agents Need This:**
- Quickly assess if a file is relevant to their task
- Understand file structure without consuming tokens on full content
- Make informed decisions about which functions to extract

#### 2. `get_symbol_references` MCP Tool

**Purpose:** AI agents need to find all usages of a function/class before modifying it.

```python
# New MCP tool for AI agents  
async def get_symbol_references(
    symbol_name: str, 
    project_root: str
) -> SymbolReferences:
    """Find all references to a symbol across the project."""
    return SymbolReferences(
        symbol_name="validate_input",
        definition_file="src/validators.py",
        definition_line=42,
        references=[
            Reference(file="src/handlers.py", line=15, context="validate_input(request.data)"),
            Reference(file="src/api.py", line=88, context="if validate_input(payload):"),
            Reference(file="tests/test_validators.py", line=12, context="assert validate_input(...)"),
        ],
        total_references=3
    )
```

**Why AI Agents Need This:**
- Safe refactoring - know all call sites before changing signature
- Impact analysis - understand blast radius of changes
- No hallucination - real references, not guessed ones

#### 3. XXE Detection (XML External Entity)

**CWE:** CWE-611

**Vulnerable Parsers:**

```python
"xxe": [
    # Vulnerable by default
    "xml.etree.ElementTree.parse",
    "xml.etree.ElementTree.fromstring",
    "xml.etree.ElementTree.iterparse",

**Example:**

```python
# VULNERABLE
@app.route('/render')
def render_template():
    template = request.args.get('template')
    return jinja2.Template(template).render()  # RCE!

# SAFE - use file-based templates
@app.route('/render')
def render_safe():
    return render_template('page.html', data=request.args.get('data'))

## v1.5.0 - "Project Intelligence"

### Overview

**Theme:** Project-Wide Understanding for AI Agents  
**Goal:** Give AI agents complete project context without reading every file  
**Effort:** ~10 developer-days  
**Risk Level:** Low (uses existing PDG infrastructure)

### Priorities

| Priority | Feature | Owner | Effort | Dependencies |
|----------|---------|-------|--------|--------------|
| **P0** | `get_project_map` MCP tool | TBD | 3 days | None |
| **P0** | `get_call_graph` MCP tool | TBD | 2 days | PDG exists |
| **P0** | `scan_dependencies` MCP tool | TBD | 3 days | None |
| **P1** | Circular dependency detection | TBD | 1 day | PDG exists |
| **P1** | JWT vulnerabilities | TBD | 2 days | None |
| **P1** | Mass assignment detection | TBD | 2 days | None |

### Technical Specifications

#### 1. `get_project_map` MCP Tool

**Purpose:** AI agents need a mental model of the entire project structure.

```python
# New MCP tool for AI agents
async def get_project_map(project_root: str) -> ProjectMap:
    """Provide AI with complete project structure."""
    return ProjectMap(
        project_root=project_root,
        total_files=47,
        total_lines=12500,
        languages={"python": 42, "yaml": 3, "json": 2},
        entry_points=["src/main.py", "src/cli.py"],
        modules=[
            Module(path="src/handlers/", purpose="HTTP request handlers", files=8),
            Module(path="src/models/", purpose="Database models", files=6),
            Module(path="src/utils/", purpose="Utility functions", files=4),
        ],
        key_files=[
            KeyFile(path="src/config.py", purpose="Configuration management"),
            KeyFile(path="src/database.py", purpose="Database connection"),
        ],
        dependency_count=23,
        test_coverage=87.5
    )
```

**Why AI Agents Need This:**
- Understand project architecture without exploring randomly
- Identify where to make changes based on purpose, not guessing
- Know which modules are related before making cross-cutting changes

#### 2. `get_call_graph` MCP Tool

**Purpose:** AI agents need to understand function relationships.

```python
# New MCP tool for AI agents
async def get_call_graph(
    entry_point: str,
    depth: int = 3
) -> CallGraph:
    """Generate call graph from entry point."""
    return CallGraph(
        entry_point="main",
        nodes=[
            Node(name="main", file="src/main.py", line=10),
            Node(name="process_request", file="src/handlers.py", line=25),
            Node(name="validate_input", file="src/validators.py", line=42),
        ],
        edges=[
            Edge(caller="main", callee="process_request"),
            Edge(caller="process_request", callee="validate_input"),
        ],
        mermaid_diagram="graph TD\\n  main --> process_request\\n  ...",
    )
```

**Why AI Agents Need This:**
- Trace execution flow to understand code behavior
- Find all functions affected by a change
- Identify dead code or unused functions

#### 3. `scan_dependencies` MCP Tool

**Purpose:** AI agents need to know about vulnerable dependencies.

```python
# New MCP tool for AI agents
async def scan_dependencies(requirements_path: str) -> DependencyReport:
    """Scan dependencies for known CVEs."""
    return DependencyReport(
        total_dependencies=23,
        vulnerable_count=2,
        vulnerabilities=[
            CVE(package="requests", version="2.25.0", cve="CVE-2023-32681", 
                severity="HIGH", fixed_in="2.31.0"),
        ]
    )
```

## v1.5.1 - "CrossFile"

### Overview

**Theme:** Multi-File Operations for AI Agents  
**Goal:** Enable AI agents to understand and modify code across file boundaries  
**Effort:** ~15 developer-days  
**Risk Level:** High (architectural complexity)

### Priorities

| Priority | Feature | Owner | Effort | Dependencies |
|----------|---------|-------|--------|--------------|
| **P0** | `extract_cross_file` MCP tool | TBD | 5 days | Import resolution |
| **P0** | Cross-file taint tracking | TBD | 5 days | Import resolution |
| **P0** | Import resolution engine | TBD | 5 days | None |

### Why AI Agents Need Cross-File Operations

**Problem:** AI agents today work file-by-file. When a function in `utils.py` is called from `handlers.py`, the AI has no way to:
1. Know what callers exist before changing a signature
2. Track if user input flows across file boundaries
3. Safely refactor code that spans multiple files

**Solution:** New MCP tools that operate at project scope.

### Technical Specifications

#### 1. `extract_cross_file` MCP Tool

```python
# New MCP tool for AI agents
async def extract_cross_file(
    symbol_name: str,
    project_root: str,
    include_callers: bool = True,
    include_callees: bool = True
) -> CrossFileExtraction:
    """Extract a symbol with all its cross-file dependencies."""
    return CrossFileExtraction(
        target=SymbolCode(name="get_user", file="models.py", code="def get_user(...)"),
        callers=[
            SymbolCode(name="handle_request", file="views.py", code="def handle_request(...)"),
        ],
        callees=[
            SymbolCode(name="execute_query", file="database.py", code="def execute_query(...)"),
        ],
        import_chain=["views.py imports models", "models.py imports database"],
    )
```

#### 2. Cross-File Taint Tracking

```
Challenge: Track taint across files

File: views.py                    File: models.py
─────────────                     ─────────────
def handle_request(req):          def get_user(user_id):
    user_id = req.args['id']  ──────>  query = f"SELECT * FROM users WHERE id={user_id}"
    return get_user(user_id)           cursor.execute(query)  # VULNERABLE!
```

**Solution: Inter-Procedural Analysis**

```python
class CrossFileTaintTracker:
    def __init__(self, project_root: str):
        self.import_graph = {}  # module -> imports
        self.function_signatures = {}  # func -> (params, return_taint)

    def analyze_project(self, entry_point: str):
        # Phase 1: Build import graph
        self.build_import_graph(entry_point)

        # Phase 2: Analyze each module
        for module in topological_sort(self.import_graph):
            self.analyze_module(module)

        # Phase 3: Propagate taint across calls
        self.propagate_cross_file_taint()
```

**Scope Limitations (v1.5.1):**
- Single-hop imports only (direct `from x import y`)
- No dynamic imports (`importlib.import_module`)
- No `sys.path` manipulation
- No circular import resolution (fail gracefully)

## v1.5.3 - "PathSmart"

### Overview

**Theme:** Intelligent Path Resolution for Docker Deployments  
**Goal:** Make file-based tools work seamlessly regardless of deployment context  
**Effort:** ~5 developer-days  
**Risk Level:** Medium (affects all file-based tools)

### Problem Statement

File-based tools fail with "File not found" when the MCP server runs in Docker and paths reference files outside the container's mount points. Users must manually configure volume mounts, which is error-prone.

**Current Error:**
```
Error: "File not found: /home/user/projects/myfile.py"
```

### Priorities

| Priority | Feature | Owner | Effort | Dependencies |
|----------|---------|-------|--------|--------------|
| **P0** | Path resolution middleware | TBD | 2 days | None |
| **P0** | Workspace root detection | TBD | 1 day | None |
| **P0** | Clear error messages with fix suggestions | TBD | 1 day | None |
| **P1** | Auto-suggest volume mount commands | TBD | 0.5 days | None |
| **P1** | `validate_paths` MCP tool | TBD | 0.5 days | None |

### Technical Specifications

#### 1. Path Resolution Middleware

```python
# New module: src/code_scalpel/mcp/path_resolver.py
class PathResolver:
    def __init__(self, workspace_roots: list[str] = None):
        self.workspace_roots = workspace_roots or ["/app/code", "/workspace", os.getcwd()]
        self.path_mappings = {}  # host_path -> container_path
    
    def resolve(self, path: str) -> str:
        """Resolve a path to its accessible location."""
        # Try direct access first
        if os.path.exists(path):
            return path
        
        # Try workspace roots
        for root in self.workspace_roots:
            candidate = os.path.join(root, os.path.basename(path))
            if os.path.exists(candidate):
                return candidate
        
        # Provide helpful error
        raise FileNotFoundError(
            f"Cannot access: {path}\n"
            f"Searched: {self.workspace_roots}\n"
            f"Suggestion: Mount your project with -v {os.path.dirname(path)}:/workspace"
        )
```

#### 2. `validate_paths` MCP Tool

```python
@mcp.tool()
async def validate_paths(
    paths: list[str],
    project_root: str = None
) -> PathValidationResult:
    """Validate that paths are accessible before running file-based operations."""
    return PathValidationResult(
        accessible=[p for p in paths if os.path.exists(p)],
        inaccessible=[p for p in paths if not os.path.exists(p)],
        suggestions=["Mount with: docker run -v /host/path:/workspace ..."],
        workspace_roots=resolver.workspace_roots,
    )
```

### Acceptance Criteria Checklist

## v1.5.4 - "DynamicImports"

### Overview

**Theme:** Dynamic Import Resolution  
**Goal:** Track imports created via `importlib` and other dynamic mechanisms  
**Effort:** ~8 developer-days  
**Risk Level:** Medium (extends import resolution engine)

### Problem Statement

The current ImportResolver only tracks static `import` and `from ... import` statements. Modern Python codebases often use dynamic imports for:
- Plugin systems (`importlib.import_module()`)
- Lazy loading (`__import__()`)
- Conditional imports based on environment
- Framework magic (Django apps, Flask blueprints)

### Priorities

|----------|---------|-------|--------|--------------|
| **P0** | Detect `importlib.import_module()` calls | TDE | 2 days | None |
| **P0** | Detect `__import__()` calls | TDE | 1 day | None |
| **P1** | Track string-based module names | TDE | 2 days | Symbolic exec |
| **P1** | Django app auto-discovery patterns | TDE | 2 days | None |

- Security posture: Ship SBOM + dependency vuln scan per release; sign artifacts (Sigstore/Cosign) and document taint rules/sanitizers + known gaps; clarify secret handling and opt-in telemetry (if any).
- Performance proof: Reproducible benchmarks (cold/warm) for import resolution, cross-file extraction, and crawl on ≥1000-file projects with budget thresholds and trend chart.
- Interoperability: Verified recipes for LangChain, LlamaIndex, Autogen, Claude Tools, OpenAI client, and VS Code/CI integrations with minimal configs.
- DX polish: One-command bootstrap (deps + sanity checks) and a smoke-test script; enhanced error messages with remediation hints; “hello-world” plus “real project” MCP examples.
- Evidence-driven releases: Bundle evidence artifacts (tests, coverage, perf, vuln scan) per release with acceptance-criteria checklist.
- Adoption signals: “Who’s using” page with reference users/case studies/testimonials and maintained contrib guide.
- Compliance & provenance: License scan summary, third-party license table, data-boundary doc (what leaves the host), optional telemetry clearly disabled by default.

### Technical Specifications

#### 1. Dynamic Import Detection

```python
# Extended ImportResolver
class ImportResolver:
    def _extract_dynamic_imports(self, tree: ast.AST, file_path: str):
        """Extract dynamically imported modules."""
        for node in ast.walk(tree):
            # importlib.import_module("module_name")
            if isinstance(node, ast.Call):
                if self._is_import_module_call(node):
                    module_name = self._extract_module_string(node)
                    if module_name:
                        self._add_dynamic_import(file_path, module_name, node.lineno)
            
            # __import__("module_name")
            if isinstance(node, ast.Call) and self._is_dunder_import(node):
                module_name = self._extract_module_string(node)
                if module_name:
                    self._add_dynamic_import(file_path, module_name, node.lineno)
    
    def _is_import_module_call(self, node: ast.Call) -> bool:
        """Check if this is importlib.import_module()."""
        if isinstance(node.func, ast.Attribute):
            return (node.func.attr == "import_module" and
                    isinstance(node.func.value, ast.Name) and
                    node.func.value.id == "importlib")
        return False
```

#### 2. New Import Types

```python
class ImportType(Enum):
    DIRECT = "import"           # import module
    FROM = "from"               # from module import name
    STAR = "star"               # from module import *
    DYNAMIC = "dynamic"         # importlib.import_module()
    DUNDER = "dunder"           # __import__()

### Technical Specifications

#### 1. Caching Layer

```python
# New module: src/code_scalpel/cache/analysis_cache.py
from functools import lru_cache
import hashlib
import pickle

class AnalysisCache:
    def __init__(self, cache_dir: str = ".code_scalpel_cache"):
        self.cache_dir = Path(cache_dir)
        self.cache_dir.mkdir(exist_ok=True)
        self.memory_cache = {}  # file_hash -> ParsedModule
    
    def get_or_parse(self, file_path: str) -> ParsedModule:
        """Get cached parse result or parse fresh."""
        file_hash = self._hash_file(file_path)
        
        # Check memory cache
        if file_hash in self.memory_cache:
            return self.memory_cache[file_hash]
        
        # Check disk cache
        cache_path = self.cache_dir / f"{file_hash}.pickle"
        if cache_path.exists():
            with open(cache_path, "rb") as f:
                result = pickle.load(f)
                self.memory_cache[file_hash] = result
                return result
        
        # Parse fresh
        result = self._parse_file(file_path)
        self.memory_cache[file_hash] = result
        with open(cache_path, "wb") as f:
            pickle.dump(result, f)
        return result
    
    def invalidate(self, file_path: str):
        """Invalidate cache for a modified file."""
        file_hash = self._hash_file(file_path)
        self.memory_cache.pop(file_hash, None)
        cache_path = self.cache_dir / f"{file_hash}.pickle"
        cache_path.unlink(missing_ok=True)
```

#### 2. Parallel File Parsing

```python
from concurrent.futures import ProcessPoolExecutor, as_completed

class ParallelParser:
    def __init__(self, max_workers: int = None):
        self.max_workers = max_workers or os.cpu_count()
    
    def parse_project(self, project_root: str) -> dict[str, ParsedModule]:
        """Parse all Python files in parallel."""
        files = list(Path(project_root).rglob("*.py"))
        results = {}
        
        with ProcessPoolExecutor(max_workers=self.max_workers) as executor:
            future_to_file = {
                executor.submit(self._parse_single, f): f 
                for f in files
            }
            
            for future in as_completed(future_to_file):
                file_path = future_to_file[future]
                try:
                    results[str(file_path)] = future.result()
                except Exception as e:
                    logger.warning(f"Failed to parse {file_path}: {e}")
        
        return results
```

#### 3. Incremental Analysis

```python
class IncrementalAnalyzer:
    def __init__(self, cache: AnalysisCache):
        self.cache = cache
        self.dependency_graph = {}  # file -> set of files that depend on it
    
    def update_file(self, file_path: str) -> set[str]:
        """Update analysis for a single file and return affected files."""
        # Invalidate this file's cache
        self.cache.invalidate(file_path)
        
        # Re-parse the file
        new_result = self.cache.get_or_parse(file_path)
        
        # Find affected files (dependents)
        affected = self.dependency_graph.get(file_path, set())
        
        # Recompute cross-file analysis only for affected files
        return affected
```

### Performance Targets

| Operation | Current (1000 files) | Target | Improvement |
|-----------|---------------------|--------|-------------|
| Import resolution | 30s | 5s | 6x |
| Cross-file extraction | 45s | 8s | 5.6x |

## v2.0.0 - "Polyglot + MCP Protocol" COMPLETE

### Overview

**Theme:** Multi-Language MCP Tools + Advanced MCP Protocol Features  
**Goal:** Enable AI agents to work surgically on TypeScript, JavaScript, and Java projects with full MCP protocol compliance  
**Effort:** ~30 developer-days  
**Risk Level:** High (new language architecture + protocol features)  
**Status:** [COMPLETE] COMPLETE - December 15, 2025

### Why Polyglot Matters for AI Agents

AI agents today are asked to work on full-stack projects: Python backends, TypeScript frontends, Java microservices. Without language-aware surgical tools, agents must:
- Guess at code structure based on text patterns
- Risk breaking syntax when modifying unfamiliar languages
- Miss language-specific vulnerabilities

**Solution:** Extend all MCP tools to support TypeScript, JavaScript, and Java with the same surgical precision as Python.

### v2.0.0 Feature Summary

| Category | Features | Status |
|----------|----------|--------|
| **Multi-Language** | TypeScript, JavaScript, Java extraction and analysis | [COMPLETE] Complete |
| **MCP Protocol P0** | Health endpoint (`/health`) for container monitoring | [COMPLETE] Complete |
| **MCP Protocol P0** | Windows path compatibility (backslash handling) | [COMPLETE] Complete |
| **MCP Protocol P0** | Stderr logging for MCP compliance | [COMPLETE] Complete |
| **MCP Protocol P1** | Progress Tokens (`ctx.report_progress()`) | [COMPLETE] Complete |
| **MCP Protocol P1** | Roots Capability (`ctx.list_roots()`) | [COMPLETE] Complete |
| **Security** | DOM XSS, eval injection, prototype pollution, Spring patterns | [COMPLETE] Complete |
| **Performance** | 20,000+ LOC/sec throughput, 99% token reduction | [COMPLETE] Verified |

### Priorities

| Priority | Feature | Owner | Effort | Status |
|----------|---------|-------|--------|--------|
| **P0** | TypeScript/JavaScript AST support | TDE | 10 days | [COMPLETE] Done |
| **P0** | `extract_code` for TS/JS/Java | TDE | 5 days | [COMPLETE] Done |
| **P0** | `security_scan` for TS/JS/Java | TDE | 8 days | [COMPLETE] Done |
| **P0** | Health endpoint for Docker monitoring | TDE | 0.5 days | [COMPLETE] Done |
| **P0** | Windows path backslash handling | TDE | 0.5 days | [COMPLETE] Done |
| **P0** | Stderr logging (MCP compliance) | TDE | 0.5 days | [COMPLETE] Done |
| **P1** | Progress Tokens for long operations | TDE | 1 day | [COMPLETE] Done |
| **P1** | Roots Capability for workspace discovery | TDE | 1 day | [COMPLETE] Done |
| **P1** | Java Spring security patterns | TDE | 5 days | [COMPLETE] Done |
| **P1** | JSX/TSX support | TDE | 3 days | [COMPLETE] Done |

### MCP Protocol Features (v2.0.0)

#### 1. Health Endpoint (P0)

**Purpose:** Enable container orchestration health checks for Docker deployments.

```python
# GET http://localhost:8594/health
{
    "status": "healthy",
    "version": "2.0.0",
    "timestamp": "2025-12-15T12:00:00Z"
}
```

**Implementation:**
- Runs on separate port (8594) to avoid conflicts with SSE (8593)
- Thread-safe with dedicated asyncio event loop
- Returns version for deployment verification

#### 2. Windows Path Compatibility (P0)

**Purpose:** Support Windows file paths with backslashes across all tools.

```python
# [20251215_BUGFIX] Normalize Windows paths
def _normalize_path(self, path: str) -> str:
    """Convert Windows backslashes to forward slashes for AST parsing."""
    return path.replace("\\", "/") if "\\" in path else path
```

**Acceptance:**
- `extract_code("K:\\project\\src\\utils.py", ...)` works correctly
- Docker volume mounts with Windows paths resolve properly

#### 3. Stderr Logging (P0)

**Purpose:** MCP protocol requires stdout for JSON-RPC, stderr for logs.

```python
# All logging now goes to stderr
import sys
logging.basicConfig(stream=sys.stderr, ...)
```

#### 4. Progress Tokens (P1)

**Purpose:** Report progress during long-running operations for better UX.

**Tools Enhanced:**
- `crawl_project` - Reports files scanned
- `cross_file_security_scan` - Reports analysis progress  
- `scan_dependencies` - Reports packages checked

```python
@mcp.tool()
async def crawl_project(root_path: str = None, ctx: Context = None) -> ...:
    if ctx:
        await ctx.report_progress(progress=i, total=len(files))
```

#### 5. Roots Capability (P1)

**Purpose:** Discover workspace roots from MCP clients for intelligent path resolution.

```python
async def _fetch_and_cache_roots(ctx: Context) -> list[str]:
    """Fetch workspace roots from MCP client."""
    global _cached_roots
    if _cached_roots is None:
        try:
            roots = await ctx.list_roots()
            _cached_roots = [str(r.uri).replace("file://", "") for r in roots]
        except Exception:
            _cached_roots = []
    return _cached_roots
```

### Technical Specifications

#### 1. Multi-Language `extract_code`

```python
# Extended MCP tool
async def extract_code(
    file_path: str = None,
    code: str = None,
    target_type: str,  # "function", "class", "method", "interface", "type"
    target_name: str,
    language: str = "auto"  # "python", "typescript", "javascript", "java", "auto"
) -> ContextualExtractionResult:
    """Surgically extract code in any supported language."""
    # Auto-detect language from file extension or content
    # Use tree-sitter for TS/JS/Java parsing
    # Return same structured result regardless of language
```

**Why This Matters:**
- AI agents can use ONE tool for all languages
- Consistent interface reduces agent confusion
- No hallucinated line numbers regardless of language

#### 2. JavaScript/TypeScript Vulnerabilities

## v2.0.1 - "Java Completion"

### Overview

**Theme:** Complete Java Language Support + Performance Tuning  
**Goal:** Full feature parity with Python/TS/JS for Java projects  
**Effort:** ~12 developer-days  
**Risk Level:** Low (Java parser stabilization)  
**Status:** PLANNED - Q4 2025/Q1 2026

### Why Java Matters for Enterprise AI

Enterprise deployments heavily use Java for backend systems. AI agents working on microservices architectures need:
- Precise method and class extraction from complex inheritance hierarchies
- Spring framework security pattern detection
- JPA/Hibernate SQL injection detection
- Maven/Gradle dependency analysis

### v2.0.1 Priority Features

| Priority | Feature | Owner | Effort | Status |
|----------|---------|-------|--------|--------|
| **P0** | Java generics and type parameters | TDE | 3 days | PLANNED |
| **P0** | Java nested classes and inner classes | TDE | 2 days | PLANNED |
| **P0** | Java annotations and reflective security | TDE | 3 days | PLANNED |
| **P1** | Spring Security patterns (LDAP, OAuth, SAML) | TDE | 4 days | DONE |
| **P1** | JPA security rule expansion | TDE | 2 days | DONE |
| **P2** | Performance: Java parsing optimization | TDE | 2 days | DONE |

### Technical Focus

```java
// Generic extraction support
public class Repository<T extends Entity> {
    public List<T> findById(String id) { }
    public Optional<T> getByName(String name) { }
}

// MCP tool handles:
// - Type parameter bounds
// - Wildcard types (? extends, ? super)
// - Intersection types
// - Method generic parameters
```

#### 2. Spring Security Patterns

```python
SPRING_SECURITY_SINKS = {
    "spring_ldap": [
        "LdapTemplate.search",
        "LdapTemplate.authenticate",
        "DirContextOperations.getStringAttribute",
    ],
    "spring_oauth": [
        "OAuth2TokenProvider.generate",
        "JwtEncoder.encode",
        "OAuthClientAuthenticationToken",
    ],
    "spring_validation": [
        "DataBinder.bind",
        "@Valid annotation processing",
        "BindingResult.hasErrors",
    ],
}
```

### Acceptance Criteria

## v2.1.0 - "MCP Enhance" (ARCHIVED)

> [20251216_DOCS] DEPRECATED - Consolidated into v2.2.0 "Nexus"

### Overview

**Theme:** Advanced MCP Protocol Features  
**Goal:** Resource Templates for parameterized access, Workflow Prompts for guided operations  
**Effort:** ~15 developer-days  
**Risk Level:** Medium (protocol extension)
**Status:** DEPRECATED - Consolidated into v2.2.0

### Why These Features Matter

AI agents need more than just tools - they need:
- **Parameterized Resources:** Access code elements without knowing exact paths
- **Guided Workflows:** Step-by-step prompts for complex operations like security audits
- **Structured Logging:** Analytics and debugging for MCP tool usage

### Priorities

| Priority | Feature | Owner | Effort | Dependencies |
|----------|---------|-------|--------|--------------|
| **P0** | Resource Templates (parameterized URIs) | TBD | 5 days | FastMCP |
| **P0** | Workflow Prompts (security audit, refactor) | TBD | 5 days | None |
| **P1** | Structured MCP Logging | TBD | 3 days | None |
| **P1** | Tool Analytics & Metrics | TBD | 2 days | Logging |
| **P2** | JS Normalizer: `super` keyword support | TBD | 1 day | None |
| **P2** | JS Normalizer: `spread_element` support | TBD | 1 day | None |
| **P2** | Suppress symbolic_execution version warning | TBD | 0.5 days | None |

### Technical Specifications

#### 1. Resource Templates

**Purpose:** Allow agents to access code elements via parameterized URIs without knowing exact file paths.

```python
# Resource Template definition
@mcp.resource("code:///{language}/{module}/{symbol}")
async def get_code_resource(language: str, module: str, symbol: str) -> Resource:
    """
    Access code elements via parameterized URI.
    
    Examples:
        code:///python/utils/calculate_tax
        code:///typescript/components/UserCard
        code:///java/services/AuthService.authenticate
    """
    # Resolve module to file path
    file_path = await resolve_module_path(language, module)
    
    # Extract symbol
    result = await extract_code(
        file_path=file_path,
        target_type="function" if "." not in symbol else "method",
        target_name=symbol,
        language=language
    )
    
    return Resource(
        uri=f"code:///{language}/{module}/{symbol}",
        mimeType="text/x-python",  # or appropriate type
        text=result.code
    )
```

**Why AI Agents Need This:**
- Natural language: "Get the calculate_tax function from utils"
- No file path guessing or hallucination
- Language-agnostic interface

#### 2. Workflow Prompts

**Purpose:** Guided multi-step workflows for common AI agent tasks.

```python
# Security Audit Workflow
@mcp.prompt("security-audit")
async def security_audit_prompt(project_path: str) -> list[Message]:
    """
    Guide an AI agent through a comprehensive security audit.
    
    Steps:
    1. Crawl project to understand structure
    2. Scan for known vulnerabilities
    3. Check dependencies for CVEs
    4. Generate report with prioritized findings
    """
    return [
        Message(role="user", content=f"""
## Security Audit Workflow for {project_path}

Follow these steps to perform a comprehensive security audit:

### Step 1: Project Analysis
Use `crawl_project` to understand the codebase structure.

### Step 2: Vulnerability Scan
Use `security_scan` on each Python/JavaScript/TypeScript file.
Use `cross_file_security_scan` for multi-file taint analysis.

### Step 3: Dependency Check
Use `scan_dependencies` to check for known CVEs.

### Step 4: Report Generation
Compile findings into a prioritized report:
- CRITICAL: Immediate action required
- HIGH: Address within 1 week
- MEDIUM: Address within 1 month
- LOW: Nice to fix

Begin by running `crawl_project("{project_path}")`.
        """)
    ]

# Refactor Workflow
@mcp.prompt("safe-refactor")
async def safe_refactor_prompt(file_path: str, symbol_name: str) -> list[Message]:
    """
    Guide an AI agent through a safe refactoring operation.
    """
    return [
        Message(role="user", content=f"""
## Safe Refactor Workflow for {symbol_name} in {file_path}

### Step 1: Extract Current Implementation
Use `extract_code` to get the current implementation.

### Step 2: Find All Usages
Use `get_symbol_references` to find all call sites.

### Step 3: Plan Changes
List all changes needed across files.

### Step 4: Simulate Refactor
Use `simulate_refactor` to verify changes are safe.

### Step 5: Apply Changes
Only if simulation passes, use `update_symbol` to apply.

Begin by running `extract_code(file_path="{file_path}", target_name="{symbol_name}")`.
        """)
    ]
```

#### 3. Structured MCP Logging

**Purpose:** Analytics and debugging for MCP tool usage.

```python
# [20251215_FEATURE] Structured logging for MCP tools
import structlog

mcp_logger = structlog.get_logger("code_scalpel.mcp")

@mcp.tool()
async def extract_code(...):
    start_time = time.time()
    
    mcp_logger.info(
        "tool_invoked",
        tool="extract_code",
        file_path=file_path,
        target_type=target_type,
        target_name=target_name,
        language=language
    )
    
    try:
        result = await _extract_code_impl(...)
        
        mcp_logger.info(
            "tool_success",
            tool="extract_code",
            duration_ms=(time.time() - start_time) * 1000,
            tokens_saved=result.tokens_saved,
            lines_extracted=result.lines
        )
        
        return result
    except Exception as e:
        mcp_logger.error(
            "tool_error",
            tool="extract_code",
            error=str(e),
            error_type=type(e).__name__

### What's Included (Consolidated from v2.0.2, v2.0.3, v2.1.0)

| Category | Features | Origin |
|----------|----------|--------|
| **Unified Graph** | Universal Node IDs, Confidence Engine, Cross-Boundary Taint, HTTP Link Detection | Original v2.2.0 |
| **JS/TS Completeness** | JSX/TSX extraction, TypeScript decorators, Bundler aliases | v2.0.2 |
| **Polyglot Reliability** | Incremental AST cache, Unified resolver, Control-flow narrowing | v2.0.3 |
| **MCP Enhance** | Resource Templates, Workflow Prompts, Structured Logging | v2.1.0 |

### Why Unified Graph Matters

AI agents currently operate on isolated views of each language. A React frontend and Spring backend appear as separate worlds. This leads to:
- **Blind refactoring** - Agent changes Java API, breaks TypeScript client
- **Guessed dependencies** - No proof that `fetch('/api/users')` connects to `@GetMapping("/api/users")`
- **Silent hallucination** - Agent presents "best guess" as fact

**Solution:** A unified graph with confidence-scored edges that explicitly distinguishes between *Definite* (static analysis) and *Probable* (heuristic) links.

### Technical Specifications

#### 1. Universal Node IDs

**Purpose:** Standardize AST node IDs across Python/Java/TypeScript so the graph engine can address any symbol uniformly.

```python
# Universal ID Format
# language::module::type::name[:method]

"python::app.handlers::class::RequestHandler"
"java::com.example.api::controller::UserController:getUser"
"typescript::src/api/client::function::fetchUsers"
```

**Omni-Schema JSON Format:**
```json
{
  "graph": {
    "nodes": [
      {"id": "java::UserController:getUser", "type": "endpoint", "route": "/api/users"},
      {"id": "typescript::fetchUsers", "type": "client", "target": "/api/users"}
    ],
    "edges": [
      {
        "from": "typescript::fetchUsers",
        "to": "java::UserController:getUser",
        "confidence": 0.95,
        "evidence": "Route string match: /api/users",
        "type": "http_call"
      }
    ]
  }
}
```

#### 2. Confidence Engine

**Purpose:** Every graph edge carries a score (0.0-1.0). AI agents must request human confirmation if confidence < threshold.

```python
# Confidence scoring rules
CONFIDENCE_RULES = {
    "import_statement": 1.0,      # import X from Y - definite
    "type_annotation": 1.0,       # User: UserType - definite
    "route_exact_match": 0.95,    # "/api/users" == "/api/users"
    "route_pattern_match": 0.8,   # "/api/users/{id}" ~= "/api/users/123"
    "string_literal_match": 0.7,  # Heuristic based on string content
    "dynamic_route": 0.5,         # "/api/" + version + "/user" - uncertain
}

# Agent workflow
async def get_dependencies(node_id: str, min_confidence: float = 0.8):
    """Return dependencies, flagging those below threshold."""
    deps = graph.get_edges(node_id)
    return {
        "definite": [d for d in deps if d.confidence >= min_confidence],
        "uncertain": [d for d in deps if d.confidence < min_confidence],
        "requires_human_approval": len([d for d in deps if d.confidence < min_confidence]) > 0
    }
```

#### 3. Cross-Boundary Taint with Confidence

**Purpose:** Track data flow across module boundaries using confidence-weighted edges.

```python
# Example: Java POJO field renamed, TypeScript interface flagged as stale
{
  "taint_flow": {
    "source": "java::User::field::email",
    "destinations": [
      {
        "node": "typescript::UserInterface::property::email",
        "confidence": 0.9,
        "status": "STALE",
        "reason": "Source field renamed from 'email' to 'emailAddress'"
      }
    ]
  }
}
```

#### 4. HTTP Link Detection

**Purpose:** Connect frontend API calls to backend endpoints.

```python
# Detection patterns
HTTP_PATTERNS = {
    "javascript": ["fetch", "axios.get", "axios.post", "$http", "ajax"],
    "typescript": ["fetch", "axios", "HttpClient"],
    "python": ["requests.get", "requests.post", "httpx.get"],
}

ENDPOINT_PATTERNS = {
    "java": ["@GetMapping", "@PostMapping", "@RequestMapping", "@RestController"],
    "python": ["@app.route", "@router.get", "@api_view"],
    "typescript": ["@Get", "@Post", "@Controller"],
}
```

#### 5. JSX/TSX Extraction + Server Components (P0, from v2.0.2)

**Purpose:** Enable surgical extraction of React components including Next.js Server Components and Server Actions.

```typescript
// JSX Component Extraction
export function UserCard({ user }: { user: User }) {
  return (
    <div className="card">
      <h2>{user.name}</h2>
      <p>{user.email}</p>
    </div>
  );
}

// Next.js Server Component
async function UserList() {
  const users = await fetchUsers();
  return <div>{users.map(u => <UserCard key={u.id} user={u} />)}</div>;
}

// Server Action
async function updateUser(formData: FormData) {
  'use server';
  const id = formData.get('id');
  await db.users.update({ id }, formData);
}
```

**Implementation:**
```python
# Extended extract_code for JSX/TSX
async def extract_code(
  file_path: str,
  target_name: str,
  language: str = "auto"
) -> ContextualExtractionResult:
  """Extract React components with JSX normalization."""
  
  if language in ["tsx", "jsx"]:
    # Normalize JSX to stable AST
    tree = tsx_parser.parse(file_path)
    
    # Handle React-specific patterns
    component = find_component(tree, target_name)
    server_directive = detect_server_directive(component)
    
    return ContextualExtractionResult(
      code=component.code,
      jsx_normalized=True,
      is_server_component=server_directive == "use server",
      dependencies=extract_jsx_imports(component)
    )
```

**Acceptance Criteria:**
- [x] Extract functional React components with JSX
- [x] Extract class components with JSX
- [x] Detect and flag Server Components (`async` function components)
- [x] Detect and flag Server Actions (`'use server'` directive)
- [x] Normalize JSX syntax for consistent analysis

**Status:** [COMPLETE] COMPLETE (v2.0.2, Dec 16, 2025)

#### 6. Resource Templates (P0, from v2.1.0)

**Purpose:** Allow agents to access code elements via parameterized URIs without knowing exact file paths.

```python
# Resource Template definition
@mcp.resource("code:///{language}/{module}/{symbol}")
async def get_code_resource(language: str, module: str, symbol: str) -> Resource:
  """
  Access code elements via parameterized URI.
  
  Examples:
    code:///python/utils/calculate_tax
    code:///typescript/components/UserCard
    code:///java/services/AuthService.authenticate
  """
  # Resolve module to file path
  file_path = await resolve_module_path(language, module)
  
  # Extract symbol
  result = await extract_code(
    file_path=file_path,
    target_type="function" if "." not in symbol else "method",
    target_name=symbol,
    language=language
  )
  
  return Resource(
    uri=f"code:///{language}/{module}/{symbol}",
    mimeType=f"text/x-{language}",
    text=result.code,
    metadata={
      "file_path": file_path,
      "line_start": result.line_start,
      "line_end": result.line_end
    }
  )
```

**Acceptance Criteria:**
- [x] Resource template URI parsing works
- [x] Module path resolution across languages
- [x] Symbol extraction via resource URIs
- [x] Proper MIME types for each language
- [x] Error handling for invalid URIs

**Status:** [COMPLETE] COMPLETE (v2.0.2, Dec 16, 2025)

#### 7. TypeScript Decorators + Metadata (P1, from v2.0.2)

**Purpose:** Parse and preserve TypeScript decorator metadata for security analysis and extraction.

```typescript
// NestJS Controller with decorators
@Controller('users')
export class UserController {
  @Get(':id')
  @UseGuards(AuthGuard)
  async getUser(@Param('id') id: string): Promise<UserDto> {
    return this.userService.findById(id);
  }
}
```

**Implementation:**
```python
# Decorator extraction and analysis
class DecoratorAnalyzer:
  def extract_decorators(self, node: TSXNode) -> list[Decorator]:
    """Extract decorators with their parameters."""
    decorators = []
    for decorator in node.decorators:
      decorators.append(Decorator(
        name=decorator.name,
        arguments=decorator.arguments,
        metadata=self._extract_metadata(decorator)
      ))
    return decorators
  
  def is_security_sink(self, decorators: list[Decorator]) -> bool:
    """Check if decorators indicate security-sensitive operations."""
    sink_decorators = {'@Post', '@Put', '@Delete', '@Patch'}
    return any(d.name in sink_decorators for d in decorators)
```

#### 8. Bundler/Module Alias Resolution (P1, from v2.0.2)

**Purpose:** Resolve module aliases from tsconfig.json, webpack, and vite configs.

```typescript
// tsconfig.json
{
  "compilerOptions": {
    "paths": {
      "@ui/*": ["./src/ui/*"],
      "@data/*": ["./packages/data/src/*"],
      "@utils": ["./src/common/utils"]
    }
  }
}

// Code uses aliases
import { Button } from '@ui/components';
import { UserService } from '@data/services';
```

**Implementation:**
```python
class AliasResolver:
  def __init__(self, project_root: str):
    self.aliases = self._load_aliases(project_root)
  
  def _load_aliases(self, project_root: str) -> dict[str, str]:
    """Load aliases from tsconfig, webpack, vite."""
    aliases = {}
    
    # tsconfig.json paths
    tsconfig = Path(project_root) / "tsconfig.json"
    if tsconfig.exists():
      config = json.loads(tsconfig.read_text())
      paths = config.get("compilerOptions", {}).get("paths", {})
      for alias, targets in paths.items():
        aliases[alias.rstrip("/*")] = targets[0].rstrip("/*")
    
    # webpack.config.js resolve.alias
    # vite.config.ts resolve.alias
    # ... similar logic
    
    return aliases
  
  def resolve(self, import_path: str) -> str:
    """Resolve alias to actual path."""
    for alias, target in self.aliases.items():
      if import_path.startswith(alias):
        return import_path.replace(alias, target, 1)
    return import_path
```

#### 9. Incremental AST Cache (P1, from v2.0.3)

**Purpose:** Cache parsed ASTs and invalidate only affected files on changes.

```python
class IncrementalASTCache:
  def __init__(self, cache_dir: str = ".scalpel_ast_cache"):
    self.cache_dir = Path(cache_dir)
    self.cache_dir.mkdir(exist_ok=True)
    self.file_hashes = {}  # file -> hash
    self.dependency_graph = {}  # file -> dependencies
  
  def get_or_parse(self, file_path: str, language: str) -> AST:
    """Get cached AST or parse fresh."""
    file_hash = self._hash_file(file_path)
    cache_path = self.cache_dir / f"{file_hash}_{language}.ast"
    
    # Check if cached and valid
    if cache_path.exists() and self.file_hashes.get(file_path) == file_hash:
      return self._load_ast(cache_path)
    
    # Parse fresh
    ast = self._parse_file(file_path, language)
    self._save_ast(cache_path, ast)
    self.file_hashes[file_path] = file_hash
    return ast
  
  def invalidate(self, file_path: str) -> set[str]:
    """Invalidate cache and return affected files."""
    # Invalidate this file
    self.file_hashes.pop(file_path, None)
    
    # Find dependents
    affected = self._find_dependents(file_path)
    
    # Invalidate dependents
    for dep in affected:
      self.file_hashes.pop(dep, None)
    
    return affected

    """)
  ]

@mcp.prompt("safe-refactor")
async def safe_refactor_prompt(file_path: str, symbol_name: str) -> list[Message]:

```python
class ContractBreachDetector:
  def __init__(self, graph: UnifiedGraph):
    self.graph = graph
  
  def detect_breaches(
    self,
    changed_node_id: str

  # Next.js
  "nextjs_ssr": [
    "getServerSideProps",
    "getStaticProps",
    "getInitialProps",
    "dangerouslySetInnerHTML",
  ],
  
  # Next.js App Router
  "nextjs_app": [
    "generateMetadata",
    "generateStaticParams",
    "Server Components",  # async function components
  ],
  
  # Next.js Server Actions
  "nextjs_actions": [
    "'use server'",  # directive
    "revalidatePath",
    "revalidateTag",
    "cookies().set",
  ],
  
  # Remix
  "remix_ssr": [
    "loader",
    "action",
    "headers",
    "json",
    "redirect",
  ],
  
  # Nuxt
  "nuxt_ssr": [
    "useAsyncData",
    "useFetch",
    "defineEventHandler",
    "setResponseHeader",
  ],
}

def detect_ssr_vulnerabilities(tree: AST, framework: str) -> list[Vulnerability]:
  """Detect SSR-specific vulnerabilities."""
  vulnerabilities = []
  
  for node in ast.walk(tree):

#### 13. TypeScript Control-Flow Narrowing (P2, from v2.0.3)

**Purpose:** Use TypeScript's type narrowing to improve taint tracking precision.

```typescript
// Example: Type guard reduces false positives
function processUser(input: unknown) {
  if (typeof input === 'string') {
    // TypeScript narrows: input is string here
    const userId = parseInt(input);  // Safe conversion
    return db.query(`SELECT * FROM users WHERE id = ${userId}`);
  }
  throw new Error('Invalid input');
}
```

**Implementation:**
```python
class TypeNarrowing:
  def analyze_control_flow(self, node: TSXNode) -> dict[str, Set[str]]:
    """
    Track type narrowing through control flow.
    
    Returns: Map of variable -> possible types at each program point

        # Type narrowed in this branch
        var = branch.condition.variable
        narrowed_type = self._extract_narrowed_type(branch.condition)
        
        type_states[var] = narrowed_type
    
    return type_states
  
  def is_taint_eliminated(
    self,
    variable: str,
    type_states: dict[str, Set[str]]
  ) -> bool:
    """Check if type narrowing eliminates taint risk."""
    current_type = type_states.get(variable)
    
    # If narrowed to primitive, less risk
    if current_type in {'number', 'boolean', 'null', 'undefined'}:
      return True
    
    # String validation narrows taint
    if current_type == 'ValidatedString':
      return True
    
    return False
```

**Acceptance Criteria:**

#### 14. Structured MCP Logging (P2, from v2.1.0)

**Purpose:** Analytics and debugging for MCP tool usage.

```python
import structlog

mcp_logger = structlog.get_logger("code_scalpel.mcp")

@mcp.tool()
async def extract_code(...):
  start_time = time.time()
  
  mcp_logger.info(

### Adversarial Validation Checklist (v2.2.0)

> **Role:** Skeptical Senior Engineer / Security Red Team  
> **Objective:** Break the claims of Code Scalpel v2.2.0  
> **Principle:** "An agent that works in Java but breaks the Frontend is useless. An agent that guesses is dangerous."

#### Regression Baseline (Must ALWAYS Pass - Stop Ship if ANY Fail)

| Criterion | Proof Command | Expected Result |
|-----------|---------------|-----------------|
| **Java Generics** | `pytest tests/test_java_normalizer.py -k generics -v` | `Repository<User>` vs `Repository<Order>` correctly extracted |
| **Spring Security** | `grep -c "LdapTemplate\|OAuth2TokenProvider" src/code_scalpel/symbolic_execution_tools/taint_tracker.py` | Both sinks defined (count > 0) |
| **Determinism** | Run `create_node_id()` twice on same input | Identical IDs both times |
| **Performance** | `python benchmarks/java_normalizer_benchmark.py` | Java parsing < 200ms |

- [x] **Java Generics:** Correctly extracts `Repository<User>` vs `Repository<Order>` [COMPLETE] VERIFIED
- [x] **Spring Security:** Accurately identifies `LdapTemplate` and `OAuth2TokenProvider` sinks [COMPLETE] VERIFIED
- [x] **Determinism:** Re-running analysis on unchanged code yields identical IDs [COMPLETE] VERIFIED
- [x] **Performance:** Java parsing remains < 200ms for standard files (actual: 0.33ms) [COMPLETE] VERIFIED

#### Adversarial Questions (Phase 4)

> *If the API route is constructed dynamically (`"/api/" + version + "/user"`), does the graph claim a link or flag uncertainty?*

**Answer:** Graph returns `match_type="dynamic"` with `confidence=0.5` - explicitly flagged as uncertain.

> *Can the agent be tricked into refactoring a "guessed" dependency?*

**Answer:** No. `get_dependencies()` returns `requires_human_approval=True` for confidence < 0.8.

#### Explicit Uncertainty (Phase 4 Gates)

| Criterion | Proof Command | Expected Result |
|-----------|---------------|-----------------|
| **Confidence Scores** | `python -c "from code_scalpel.graph_engine.confidence import CONFIDENCE_RULES; print([f'{k.value}: {v}' for k,v in CONFIDENCE_RULES.items()])"` | Heuristics < 1.0 |
| **Threshold Enforcement** | Create edge with 0.5 confidence, call `get_dependencies(min_confidence=0.8)` | `requires_human_approval=True` |
| **Evidence Strings** | `score_edge(EdgeType.ROUTE_EXACT_MATCH, {})` | Returns explanation string |

- [x] **Confidence Scores:** Every heuristic link has confidence < 1.0 [COMPLETE] VERIFIED
  - `import_statement`: 1.0 (definite)
  - `type_annotation`: 1.0 (definite)
  - `inheritance`: 1.0 (definite)
  - `direct_call`: 0.95 (heuristic)
  - `route_exact_match`: 0.95 (heuristic)
  - `dynamic_route`: 0.5 (uncertain)
- [x] **Threshold Enforcement:** Agents BLOCKED from acting on confidence < 0.8 links without human approval [COMPLETE] VERIFIED
- [x] **Evidence:** Tool returns *why* it linked two nodes (e.g., "Base: route_exact_match | Level: high") [COMPLETE] VERIFIED

#### Cross-Boundary Linking

| Criterion | Proof Command | Expected Result |
|-----------|---------------|-----------------|
| **HTTP Links** | `pytest tests/test_graph_engine_http_detector.py -v` | fetch(JS) → @RequestMapping(Java) connected |
| **Type Syncing** | `pytest tests/test_contract_breach_detector.py -v` | Java field change flags TS interface as "Stale" |

- [x] **HTTP Links:** Graph connects `fetch` (JS) to `@RequestMapping` (Java) [COMPLETE] VERIFIED (26 tests pass)
- [x] **Type Syncing:** Changing a Java Class field flags the corresponding TypeScript Interface as "Stale" [COMPLETE] VERIFIED (19 tests pass)

#### Zero Silent Hallucinations

| Check | Status | Evidence |
|-------|--------|----------|
| Definite links (1.0) | Only `import`, `type_annotation`, `inheritance` | [COMPLETE] Verified in CONFIDENCE_RULES |
| Heuristic links | Always < 1.0 | [COMPLETE] Verified: max heuristic = 0.95 |
| Evidence required | All edges have explanation | [COMPLETE] Verified: `evidence.explanation` always populated |

[DEPRECATED] **Fail Condition:** If the tool presents a "Best Guess" as a "Fact" (Silent Hallucination)

**Status:** [COMPLETE] PASS - All heuristics explicitly scored < 1.0 with evidence strings

#### 5. P0: Confidence Decay (From 3rd Party Review)

<!-- [20251216_FEATURE] Added per 3rd party security review feedback -->

**Purpose:** Prevent false confidence in long dependency chains. Without decay, an agent might claim 90% confidence on a 5-hop chain where each hop is 90% confident, when the actual confidence is only 59%.

**Problem Statement:**
```
A -> B -> C -> D -> E (5 hops, each 0.9 confidence)
Naive calculation: "I'm 90% confident" 
Reality: 0.9^5 = 0.59 (barely above uncertainty threshold)
```

- [x] **ADV-2.5.2 Threshold Rejection:** Verify that an agent is blocked from acting on a deep transitive dependency that falls below the `min_confidence` threshold (e.g., depth 7+ with 0.9 decay → confidence < 0.5). The system must refuse to provide context for low-confidence symbols. [COMPLETE]

#### 6. P0: Graph Neighborhood View (From 3rd Party Review)

<!-- [20251216_FEATURE] Added per 3rd party security review feedback - R-02 Graph Explosion mitigation -->

**Purpose:** LLM context windows are limited (typically 8K-128K tokens). A full project graph can have 50,000+ nodes. This feature extracts a k-hop subgraph centered on a target node, optimized for AI agent consumption.

**Problem Statement:**
```
Full graph: 50,000 nodes, 200,000 edges → Exceeds context window

#### 7. P0: Cryptographic Policy Verification (From 3rd Party Review)

<!-- [20251216_FEATURE] Added per 3rd party security review feedback - strengthens Tamper Resistance -->

**Purpose:** File permissions (chmod 0444) can be bypassed by a smart agent using `chmod +w`. This feature adds cryptographic verification using SHA-256 signed manifests stored outside the agent's control.

**Problem Statement:**
```
Current: policy.yaml protected by file permissions
Bypass:  Agent runs `chmod +w .code-scalpel/policy.yaml && echo "allow_all" > policy.yaml`
Solution: Verify SHA-256 hash against signed manifest in git history or external store
```

**Implementation:**

```python
# src/code_scalpel/policy_engine/crypto_verify.py
import hashlib
import hmac
import json
from pathlib import Path
from typing import Optional
from dataclasses import dataclass

@dataclass

### Adversarial Validation Checklist (v2.5.0)

> **Role:** Skeptical Senior Engineer / Security Red Team  
> **Objective:** Break the claims of Code Scalpel v2.5.0  
> **Principle:** "You can enforce 'Thou Shalt Not' rules on the Agent."

#### Adversarial Questions (Phase 5)

> *Can an agent bypass a "No SQL" policy by using a String Builder?*

**Expected:** No. Semantic blocking tracks data flow through StringBuilder and flags SQL construction.

**Proof Required:**
```python
# Test: test_policy_sql_via_stringbuilder.py
def test_blocks_sql_via_stringbuilder():
    code = """
    StringBuilder query = new StringBuilder();
    query.append("SELECT * FROM users WHERE id=");
    query.append(userId);  // Tainted
    statement.execute(query.toString());
    """
    result = policy_engine.evaluate(Operation(code=code, language="java"))
    assert not result.allowed
    assert "Raw SQL detected" in result.reason
```

> *Does the policy engine fail "Open" or "Closed"? (Must fail Closed).*

**Expected:** Closed. Any policy parsing error results in DENY ALL.

**Proof Required:**
```python
# Test: test_policy_fails_closed.py
def test_policy_engine_fails_closed_on_error():
    # Corrupt policy file
    with open(".code-scalpel/policy.yaml", "w") as f:
        f.write("invalid: yaml: syntax:")
    
    # Attempt operation
    with pytest.raises(PolicyError) as exc_info:
        policy_engine.evaluate(Operation(...))
    
    assert "Failing CLOSED" in str(exc_info.value)
```

## v3.0.0 - "Autonomy" (Self-Correction Loop)

### Overview

**Theme:** Supervised Repair  
**Goal:** Agents rely on Code Scalpel to fix their own mistakes under strict supervision  
**Effort:** ~40 developer-days  
**Risk Level:** Critical (autonomous operation)  
**Timeline:** Q2 2026 (Target: End of June 2026)  
**North Star:** "The system teaches the agent how to fix itself."

### Why Self-Correction Matters

Current AI agents fail silently and require human intervention for every error:
- **Build failures** - Agent breaks compilation, developer must diagnose
- **Test regressions** - Agent introduces bugs, CI catches them too late
- **Infinite retry loops** - Agent tries the same broken approach repeatedly
- **No learning** - Each failure starts from scratch

**Solution:** A feedback loop that converts errors into actionable diffs, validates fixes in a sandbox, and terminates safely when stuck.

### Priorities

| Priority | Feature | Owner | Effort | Dependencies |
|----------|---------|-------|--------|--------------|
| **P0** | Error-to-Diff Engine | TBD | 12 days | v2.5.0 |
| **P0** | Speculative Execution (Sandboxed) | TBD | 10 days | Error-to-Diff |
| **P0** | Fix Loop Termination | TBD | 5 days | Error-to-Diff |
| **P0** | Mutation Test Gate | TBD | 5 days | Speculative Execution | <!-- [20251216_FEATURE] 3rd party review feedback -->
| **P0** | Governance Config Integration | TBD | 2 days | All above | <!-- [20251218_FEATURE] Config-driven limits and critical paths -->
| **P0** | Ecosystem Integration | TBD | 8 days | All above |
| **P1** | Full Audit Trail | TBD | 5 days | All above |

**Error Pattern Examples:**

```python
# Python syntax error
# Input: "def foo()\n    pass"
# Error: "SyntaxError: expected ':' after function definition"
# Fix:   "def foo():\n    pass"

# Python NameError
# Input: "result = calcualte_total(items)"
# Error: "NameError: name 'calcualte_total' is not defined"
# Fixes: [
#   {"diff": "s/calcualte_total/calculate_total/", "confidence": 0.9},  # Typo correction
#   {"diff": "from utils import calcualte_total", "confidence": 0.5}   # Import suggestion
# ]

# TypeScript type error
# Input: "const user: User = { name: 'John' }"
# Error: "Property 'email' is missing in type '{ name: string }'"
# Fix:   "const user: User = { name: 'John', email: '' }"

# Test failure
# Input: "assert calculate_tax(100) == 15"
# Error: "AssertionError: assert 10 == 15"
# Fix:   "assert calculate_tax(100) == 10"  # Or fix calculate_tax function

#### 4. P0: Mutation Test Gate (From 3rd Party Review)

<!-- [20251216_FEATURE] Added per 3rd party security review feedback -->

**Purpose:** Prevent "hollow fixes" where an agent claims success because tests pass, but the fix actually deleted functionality (e.g., `def test(): pass`). Verify that tests would fail if the bug were reintroduced.

**Problem Statement:**
```python
# Original test (failing)
def test_calculate_tax():
    assert calculate_tax(100, 0.1) == 10

# Agent's "fix" - hollow, deletes functionality
def test_calculate_tax():
    pass  # Tests pass now! But we lost the test.

# Or worse - function hollowed out
def calculate_tax(amount, rate):
    return 0  # Tests might pass if assertions were weak
```

**Solution:** Mutation testing verifies that reverting the fix causes tests to fail again.

**Implementation:**

```python
# src/code_scalpel/autonomy/mutation_gate.py

from enum import Enum

#### 6. Governance Config Integration

<!-- [20251218_FEATURE] Config-driven limits with critical paths support -->

**Purpose:** Integrate governance configuration system to provide configurable change budgeting, blast radius controls, and critical path protection for autonomous operations.

**Configuration Source:** `.code-scalpel/config.json` at project root (see `docs/configuration/governance_config_schema.md` for full specification)

**Key Features:**
- **Change Budgeting**: Configurable limits on lines, files, and complexity changes
- **Blast Radius Control**: Limit impact scope with call graph depth analysis
- **Critical Paths**: Stricter controls for security-sensitive directories
- **Environment Overrides**: System-wide settings via environment variables
- **Immutability Protection**: SHA-256 hash validation and HMAC signatures

```

**Environment Variable Overrides:**

```bash
# Override max lines for CI/CD
export SCALPEL_CHANGE_BUDGET_MAX_LINES=1000

# Set critical paths system-wide
export SCALPEL_CRITICAL_PATHS="src/core/,src/security/,src/mcp/server.py"

# Stricter limits for critical paths
export SCALPEL_CRITICAL_PATH_MAX_LINES=25
export SCALPEL_CRITICAL_PATH_MAX_COMPLEXITY_DELTA=5
```

**Integration Points:**

1. **AutonomyEngine** - Load config on initialization, apply limits throughout fix loop
2. **ChangeBudgeting** - Use configured limits for line/file/complexity checks
3. **BlastRadiusCalculator** - Check critical paths, apply stricter limits
4. **FixLoop** - Use configured max_attempts and escalation rules
5. **MCP Tools** - Respect governance limits in all autonomous operations

### Adversarial Validation Checklist (v3.0.0)

> **Role:** Skeptical Senior Engineer / Security Red Team  
> **Objective:** Break the claims of Code Scalpel v3.0.0  
> **Principle:** "The system teaches the agent how to fix itself."

#### Adversarial Questions (Phase 6)

> *If the agent enters a fix-break-fix loop, does Scalpel stop it?*

**Expected:** Yes. Hard `max_attempts` limit (default: 5) terminates loop and escalates to human.

> *Are the "Fix Hints" actually valid code?*

**Expected:** Yes. Hints are AST-validated before presentation. Invalid hints are filtered.

#### Feedback Quality

| Criterion | Proof Command | Expected Result |
|-----------|---------------|-----------------|
| **Valid Diffs** | Generate fix hint for syntax error | Hint contains valid AST operation |
| **Loop Termination** | Trigger 10 consecutive failures | Loop terminates at max_attempts |
| **Escalation** | Exceed max_attempts | Human escalation triggered |
| **Hint Accuracy** | Run 100 error scenarios | 50%+ hints lead to successful fix |

- [x] Error messages contain valid diffs or specific AST operations to correct issue [COMPLETE] <!-- [20251218_DOCS] test_error_to_diff.py - 27 tests -->
- [x] Feedback loop terminates (fails) after N attempts (configurable, default 5) [COMPLETE] <!-- [20251218_DOCS] test_fix_loop.py - 12 tests -->
- [x] Fix hints are AST-validated before presentation [COMPLETE]
- [x] Agent retry success rate improves >50% with hints [COMPLETE] <!-- Validated in v3.0.0_autonomy_evidence.json -->

#### Simulation

| Criterion | Proof Command | Expected Result |
|-----------|---------------|-----------------|
| **Predict Failures** | `simulate_edit` on breaking change | Correctly predicts test failure |
| **No Side Effects** | Run simulation, check file system | Main tree untouched |
| **Sandbox Isolation** | Simulate with network call | Network call blocked |

- [x] `simulate_edit` correctly predicts test failures without writing to disk [COMPLETE] <!-- [20251218_DOCS] test_sandbox.py - 41 tests -->
- [x] Sandbox environment isolates side effects [COMPLETE]
- [x] Network calls blocked in sandbox [COMPLETE]
- [x] Database writes blocked in sandbox [COMPLETE]

#### Fix Loop Safety

| Scenario | Expected Behavior |
|----------|-------------------|
| Successful fix on attempt 1 | Return success, log attempt |
| Successful fix on attempt 3 | Return success, log all attempts |
| Failure after max_attempts | Terminate, escalate to human |
| Fix that breaks other tests | Reject fix, try alternative |
| Fix that introduces vulnerability | Reject fix, flag security issue |

[DEPRECATED] **Fail Condition:** If the agent reports "Fixed" but the build fails in CI

## v3.0.1 - Configuration Management & Security Hardening

### Overview

**Theme:** Enterprise Configuration  
**Goal:** Provide immutable governance configuration with blast radius controls  
**Effort:** ~3 developer-days  
**Risk Level:** Low (non-breaking enhancements)  
**Released:** December 19, 2025

### Why This Release

The v3.0.0 release introduced powerful autonomy features (self-correction, sandbox execution), but enterprises need fine-grained control over:
- **Blast radius limits** - Prevent agents from modifying too many files
- **Critical path protection** - Lock down security-sensitive code
- **Configuration immutability** - Tamper-resistant settings with hash validation

### Features Released

| Priority | Feature | Status | Evidence |
|----------|---------|--------|----------|
| **P0** | `.code-scalpel` Configuration Directory | [COMPLETE] | `docs/configuration/governance_config_schema.md` |
| **P0** | Governance Config Schema | [COMPLETE] | YAML/JSON schema with validation |
| **P0** | Blast Radius Controls | [COMPLETE] | `max_files_per_operation`, `max_lines_changed` |
| **P0** | Critical Path Protection | [COMPLETE] | `protected_paths` glob patterns |
| **P0** | Configuration Hash Validation | [COMPLETE] | SHA-256 integrity verification |
| **P0** | HMAC Signing Support | [COMPLETE] | Tamper detection for team configs |
| **P1** | Security Hardening (13 Bandit issues) | [COMPLETE] | All HIGH/MEDIUM severity resolved |
| **P1** | Safe XML Parsing (defusedxml) | [COMPLETE] | XXE attack prevention |
| **P1** | URL Scheme Validation | [COMPLETE] | Prevent file:// exploitation |

### Security Fixes (Bandit Scan)

**HIGH Severity (3 issues - B602):**
- `sandbox.py`: Replace `shell=True` with `shlex.split()` for safe command execution
- Prevents command injection in build, lint, and test subprocess calls

**MEDIUM Severity (10 issues):**
- `dependency_parser.py` (B314): Use `defusedxml` instead of `xml.etree.ElementTree`
- `osv_client.py` (B310): Add URL scheme validation for `urlopen`
- Cache files (B301 - 4 instances): Add `nosec` comments for `pickle.load` (internal caches with hash validation)
- `cli.py`, `server.py` (B104 - 4 instances): Add `nosec` for `0.0.0.0` binding (intentional server functionality)

### Configuration Schema Example

## v3.0.2 - Configuration Initialization & First-Run Experience

### Overview

**Theme:** User Experience Enhancement  
**Goal:** Auto-initialize .code-scalpel configuration directory for first-time users  
**Effort:** ~1 developer-day  
**Risk Level:** Low (non-breaking enhancement)  
**Status:** In Development  
**Target Release:** December 19, 2025

### Why This Release

The v3.0.1 release introduced the `.code-scalpel` configuration directory for governance controls, but users installing via `pip install code-scalpel` had no easy way to:
- Discover that configuration is required
- Initialize the directory with sensible defaults
- Understand what files need to be created

This release adds a `code-scalpel init` command to solve the first-run experience problem.

### Features Planned

| Priority | Feature | Status | Evidence |
|----------|---------|--------|----------|
| **P0** | `code-scalpel init` CLI Command | [IN PROGRESS] | Created templates, CLI integration |
| **P0** | Configuration Templates Module | [COMPLETE] | `src/code_scalpel/config/templates.py` |
| **P0** | Initialization Logic | [COMPLETE] | `src/code_scalpel/config/init_config.py` |
| **P0** | User-Friendly Output | [COMPLETE] | Step-by-step guidance after init |
| **P1** | --force Flag Support | [COMPLETE] | Reinitialize existing directories |
| **P1** | --dir Flag Support | [COMPLETE] | Initialize in custom directory |
| **P1** | Documentation Update | [COMPLETE] | README.md quick start update |

### CLI Usage

```bash
# Initialize in current directory
code-scalpel init

# Initialize in specific directory
code-scalpel init --dir /path/to/project

# Force reinitialize (requires manual deletion)
code-scalpel init --force
```

### What Gets Created

The `init` command creates the following structure:

```
.code-scalpel/
├── config.json      # Main governance configuration (JSON format)
├── policy.yaml      # Security rules and enforcement mode
├── budget.yaml      # Change limits and blast radius controls
├── README.md        # Configuration guide
└── .gitignore       # Runtime files to exclude
```

### Template Contents

**config.json:**
- Main governance configuration in JSON format
- Blast radius controls (max files, lines, functions, classes)
- Protected paths with glob patterns
- Allowed/denied operations
- Enforcement mode and violation handling
- Audit trail settings
- Integrity verification settings

**policy.yaml:**
- Security rules (SQL injection, command injection, XSS, etc.)
- Enforcement mode (warn/block/disabled)
- Customizable rulesets

**budget.yaml:**
- Change budgeting controls
- Max files per operation
- Max lines changed
- Max functions modified

**README.md:**
- Configuration overview
- Usage examples
- Link to full documentation

**.gitignore:**
- Excludes runtime files (audit.log, policy.manifest.json)
- Preserves configuration files for version control

### Release Checklist

[x] Configuration Templates Created [COMPLETE]
[x] Initialization Function Implemented [COMPLETE]
[x] CLI Integration Added [COMPLETE]
[x] Argument Parsing (--dir, --force) [COMPLETE]
[x] User-Friendly Output [COMPLETE]
[x] Error Handling (existing dir) [COMPLETE]
[x] Tested in Clean Environment [COMPLETE]
[x] Version Updated: `__init__.py`, `pyproject.toml` [COMPLETE]
[x] Documentation: README.md quick start [COMPLETE]
[x] Release Notes: `RELEASE_NOTES_v3.0.2.md` [COMPLETE]
[x] Tests Passing: 4133 passed, 20 skipped, 94% coverage [COMPLETE]
[x] Evidence Files: `release_artifacts/v3.0.2/` [COMPLETE]
[ ] PyPI Published: v3.0.2 [PENDING]

### Implementation Notes

**Files Created:**
- `src/code_scalpel/config/templates.py` - Template strings for all config files
- `src/code_scalpel/config/init_config.py` - `init_config_dir()` function
- `src/code_scalpel/cli.py` - Added `init` subcommand and handler

**Design Decisions:**
- Templates include comprehensive comments explaining each option
- Init command is idempotent (won't overwrite existing directory)
- Helpful next-steps guidance printed after initialization
- Four template files balance completeness with simplicity

**Testing Evidence:**
```bash
# Successful initialization
$ code-scalpel init
[SUCCESS] Configuration directory created: /tmp/test_init/.code-scalpel
Created 5 files: policy.yaml, budget.yaml, README.md, .gitignore, config.json

# Idempotent behavior
$ code-scalpel init
[OK] Configuration directory already exists.
Use --force to attempt reinitialization.
```

## v3.0.5 - "Pro Features" (Rate Limiting & Licensing)

### Overview

**Theme:** The Monetization  
**Goal:** Implement Pro tier rate limiting and licensing infrastructure  
**Effort:** ~1-2 developer-days  
**Status:** PLANNED

### Motivation

Enable sustainable development by implementing tiered rate limiting:
- **Community tier:** 100 MCP tool calls/day (free)
- **Pro/Enterprise tier:** Unlimited (paid license)

---

### Feature: Unlimited Rate Limits (Pro)

#### What It Does

Limits scope of AI agent tool calls with hard caps for community users while providing unlimited access for Pro/Enterprise subscribers.

    "remaining": 73,
    "limit": 100,
    "reset_at": "2025-12-20T00:00:00Z"
  }
}
```

#### Constraint Checks

| Check | Tier | Behavior |
|-------|------|----------|
| Pro/Enterprise license | pro, enterprise | Always allow (remaining: -1) |
| Community within limit | community | Allow, decrement remaining |
| Community at limit | community | Deny with upgrade message |
| Invalid license | - | Treat as community |

#### Configuration

Environment variables:
- `SCALPEL_LICENSE_KEY`: Pro/Enterprise license key
- `SCALPEL_LICENSE_TIER`: Override tier (for testing)

## v3.0.6 - "Vuln Sync" (Priority Vulnerability Database Updates)

### Overview

**Theme:** The Informed  
**Goal:** Provide Pro/Enterprise users with real-time vulnerability database updates  
**Effort:** ~2-3 developer-days  
**Status:** PLANNED

### Motivation

Security vulnerabilities are discovered daily. Community users receive monthly bundled updates, 
while Pro/Enterprise users get real-time hourly sync with the latest vulnerability patterns.

- **Community tier:** Monthly updates (bundled with releases)
- **Pro/Enterprise tier:** Real-time sync (hourly check against API)

---

### Feature: Priority Vulnerability Database Updates (Pro)

#### What It Does

Keeps vulnerability detection patterns up-to-date with the latest CVEs and CWEs. Pro users 
get immediate access to new patterns as they're added to the Code Scalpel vulnerability database.

#### Technical Implementation

- ✅ Framework auto-detection from imports and patterns
- ✅ 55 comprehensive tests covering all frameworks

**What v3.0.4 Detects:**
```python
# This is now DETECTED as CWE-20 (Unvalidated Input in HTTP Response):
body = request.get_json(force=True, silent=True) or {}
role = body.get("role")  # Tainted
return jsonify({"storedRole": role})  # VULNERABILITY: Unvalidated tainted data in response
```

```typescript
// This is now DETECTED as CWE-79 (XSS via innerHTML):
const [userInput, setUserInput] = useState('');
// onChange={(e) => setUserInput(e.target.value)}
<div dangerouslySetInnerHTML={{ __html: userInput }} />  // VULNERABILITY
```

---

### Gap Fix 1: Multi-Language Security Scanning

**Gap:** `security_scan` MCP tool only used Python's `ast.parse()`, making it Python-only
despite claims of JS/TS/Java support.

**Fix:** Enhanced `_security_scan_sync()` to detect file language and use `UnifiedSinkDetector`
for non-Python languages (JavaScript, TypeScript, Java).

**Fix Location:** `src/code_scalpel/mcp/server.py`

**Before:** SecurityAnalyzer (Python-only) for all files
**After:** 
- Python files → Full SecurityAnalyzer with taint tracking
- JS/TS/Java files → UnifiedSinkDetector with pattern matching

**Impact:** Stage 3.5 (ORM Escape Detection) now works for JavaScript and Java, not just Python.

---

### Gap Fix 2: Trust Boundary Detection

**Gap:** Flask's `request.get_json()` was not recognized as a taint source.

**Fix:** Added missing taint source patterns to both:
- `taint_tracker.py` - `TAINT_SOURCE_PATTERNS`
- `cross_file_taint.py` - `TAINT_SOURCES`

**Added Patterns:**
```python
"request.get_json": TaintSource.USER_INPUT,
"request.get_data": TaintSource.USER_INPUT,
```

**Impact:** Stage 3.1 (Type System Evaporation) backend detection now works.

---

### Bugs Fixed

#### 1. MCP Language Auto-Detection Failure

**Problem:** The `analyze_code` MCP tool had `language="python"` as the default parameter, 
causing all JavaScript/TypeScript files to be incorrectly parsed as Python.

**Root Cause:** Hard-coded default in function signature instead of using auto-detection.

**Fix Location:** `src/code_scalpel/mcp/server.py` - `_analyze_code_sync()` function

**Before:**
```python
async def _analyze_code(language: str = "python", code: str = "") -> str:
```

**After:**
```python
async def _analyze_code(language: str = "auto", code: str = "") -> str:
    # Auto-detect language if not specified
    if language == "auto":
        language = detect_language(code)
```

#### 2. UTF-8 BOM Not Stripped

**Problem:** Files with UTF-8 BOM (Byte Order Mark, `\ufeff`) prefix caused parse errors
because the BOM was treated as part of the code content.

**Root Cause:** No BOM stripping before parsing.

**Fix Location:** Both `src/code_scalpel/cli.py` and `src/code_scalpel/mcp/server.py`

**Fix:**
```python
# Strip UTF-8 BOM if present
if code.startswith('\ufeff'):
    code = code[1:]
```

#### 3. CLI Extension Mapping Incomplete

**Problem:** TypeScript and modern JavaScript file extensions were not recognized,
causing incorrect language detection for `.ts`, `.tsx`, `.jsx`, `.mjs`, `.cjs` files.

**Root Cause:** Extension map only included basic `.py`, `.js`, `.java` extensions.

**Fix Location:** `src/code_scalpel/cli.py` - `extension_map` dictionary

**Extended Mapping:**
```python
extension_map = {
    ".py": "python", ".pyi": "python", ".pyw": "python",
    ".js": "javascript", ".mjs": "javascript", ".cjs": "javascript",
    ".jsx": "javascript",
    ".ts": "typescript", ".tsx": "typescript",
    ".mts": "typescript", ".cts": "typescript",
    ".java": "java",
    ".json": "json",
}
```

#### 4. verify_policy_integrity SecurityError Scope Bug

**Problem:** The `verify_policy_integrity` MCP tool crashed with "local variable 'SecurityError' 
referenced before assignment" when the policy directory didn't exist.

**Root Cause:** `SecurityError` was imported inside a `try` block, then caught in `except SecurityError`. 
If the import failed, `SecurityError` was undefined but the except clause tried to reference it.

**Fix Location:** `src/code_scalpel/mcp/server.py` - `_verify_policy_integrity_sync()` function

**Before:**
```python
def _verify_policy_integrity_sync(...):
    try:
        from code_scalpel.policy_engine import (
            CryptographicPolicyVerifier,
            SecurityError,  # Inside try block!
        )
        ...
    except SecurityError as e:  # BUG: SecurityError undefined if import failed
        ...
```

**After:**
```python
def _verify_policy_integrity_sync(...):
    # Import SecurityError first so it's available for exception handling
    from code_scalpel.policy_engine.crypto_verify import SecurityError
    
    try:
        from code_scalpel.policy_engine import CryptographicPolicyVerifier
        ...
    except SecurityError as e:  # Now works even if other imports fail
        ...
```

#### 5. Trust Boundary Detection - Missing Flask Method Forms

**Problem:** Flask's `request.get_json()` method was not recognized as a taint source,
causing the Ninja Warrior Stage 3.1 test to fail. The backend receiver using 
`body = request.get_json()` was not flagged as receiving external/untrusted input.

**Root Cause:** Taint source patterns only included `request.json` (property access form),
not `request.get_json()` (method call form).

**Fix Location:** 
- `src/code_scalpel/symbolic_execution_tools/taint_tracker.py` - `TAINT_SOURCE_PATTERNS`
- `src/code_scalpel/symbolic_execution_tools/cross_file_taint.py` - `TAINT_SOURCES`

**Added Patterns:**
```python
# taint_tracker.py TAINT_SOURCE_PATTERNS
"request.get_json": TaintSource.USER_INPUT,
"request.get_data": TaintSource.USER_INPUT,

# cross_file_taint.py TAINT_SOURCES  
"request.get_json": CrossFileTaintSource.RETURN_VALUE,
"request.get_data": CrossFileTaintSource.RETURN_VALUE,
```

**Impact:** Stage 3.1 (Type System Evaporation) test should now properly flag
`request.get_json()` as a trust boundary where external data enters the system.

---

#### 6. JavaScript/TypeScript analyze_code Support

**Problem:** The `analyze_code` MCP tool only worked for Python and Java. JavaScript and 
TypeScript files were incorrectly parsed using Python's `ast.parse()`, causing syntax errors.

**Root Cause:** The `_analyze_code_sync()` function only had special handling for Java. 
All other languages fell through to Python's AST parser.

**Fix Location:** `src/code_scalpel/mcp/server.py`

**Solution:** Added `_analyze_javascript_code()` function that uses tree-sitter to parse 
JavaScript and TypeScript, extracting:
- Function declarations (regular, arrow, async)
- Class declarations with method extraction
- ES6 imports and CommonJS require() statements
- Cyclomatic complexity estimation

```python
def _analyze_javascript_code(code: str, is_typescript: bool = False) -> AnalysisResult:
    """
    Analyze JavaScript/TypeScript code using tree-sitter.
    [20251220_FEATURE] v3.0.4 - Multi-language analyze_code support.
    """
    if is_typescript:
        import tree_sitter_typescript as ts_ts
        TS_LANGUAGE = Language(ts_ts.language_typescript())
        parser = Parser(TS_LANGUAGE)
    else:
        import tree_sitter_javascript as ts_js
        JS_LANGUAGE = Language(ts_js.language())
        parser = Parser(JS_LANGUAGE)
    # ... tree traversal for functions, classes, imports
```

**Impact:** Stage 1 Parser Gauntlet tests (1.1-1.5) now pass for JavaScript files.

---

#### 7. Java tree-sitter API Update

**Problem:** Java analysis failed with "'tree_sitter.Parser' object has no attribute 'set_language'"
error. The tree-sitter library API had changed.

**Root Cause:** The Java parser used the old tree-sitter API:
```python
parser = Parser()
parser.set_language(self.JAVA_LANGUAGE)  # Old API - no longer works
```

**Fix Location:** `src/code_scalpel/code_parser/java_parsers/java_parser_treesitter.py`

**Fix:**
```python
# [20251220_BUGFIX] v3.0.4 - Use new tree-sitter API
self.parser = Parser(self.JAVA_LANGUAGE)  # New API
```

**Impact:** Stage 3.3 (Trust Boundary Blindness) Java test now passes.

---

#### 8. Type System Evaporation - Unvalidated Input Detection

**Problem:** The Ninja Warrior Stage 3.1 (Type System Evaporation) test expected detection of 
unvalidated external input being returned in HTTP responses. The backend code:
```python
body = request.get_json(force=True, silent=True) or {}
role = body.get("role")  # Tainted from external source
return jsonify({"storedRole": role})  # SHOULD BE FLAGGED
```
was not flagged because:
1. `jsonify()` was not recognized as a security sink
2. Dictionary values were not checked for taint
3. `or {}` pattern broke taint propagation

**Root Cause:** Three issues:
1. No sink type for "unvalidated input in HTTP response"
2. Sink checking only examined direct arguments, not dict values
3. BoolOp expressions not handled in taint source detection

**Fixes Applied:**

**Fix 1:** Added new `SecuritySink.UNVALIDATED_OUTPUT` type (CWE-20)
- Location: `src/code_scalpel/symbolic_execution_tools/taint_tracker.py`
```python
UNVALIDATED_OUTPUT = auto()  # Tainted data returned in HTTP response without validation (CWE-20)
```

**Fix 2:** Added HTTP response functions to SINK_PATTERNS
- Location: `src/code_scalpel/symbolic_execution_tools/taint_tracker.py`
```python
"jsonify": SecuritySink.UNVALIDATED_OUTPUT,
"flask.jsonify": SecuritySink.UNVALIDATED_OUTPUT,
"json.dumps": SecuritySink.UNVALIDATED_OUTPUT,
"JSONResponse": SecuritySink.UNVALIDATED_OUTPUT,  # FastAPI
"fastapi.responses.JSONResponse": SecuritySink.UNVALIDATED_OUTPUT,
"starlette.responses.JSONResponse": SecuritySink.UNVALIDATED_OUTPUT,
"Response.json": SecuritySink.UNVALIDATED_OUTPUT,  # Django REST Framework
```

**Fix 3:** Added dictionary value checking in sink analysis
- Location: `src/code_scalpel/symbolic_execution_tools/security_analyzer.py`
```python
# [20251229_FEATURE] v3.0.4 - Type System Evaporation: Check dict values
elif isinstance(arg, ast.Dict):
    # Dictionary literal: jsonify({"key": tainted_value})
    for value in arg.values:
        if value is not None:
            arg_vars = self._extract_variable_names(value)
            for var in arg_vars:
                self._taint_tracker.check_sink(var, sink, location)
```

**Fix 4:** Added BoolOp handling in taint source detection
- Location: `src/code_scalpel/symbolic_execution_tools/security_analyzer.py`
```python
# [20251229_FEATURE] v3.0.4 - Type System Evaporation: Handle BoolOp (or/and)
# e.g., body = request.get_json() or {}
elif isinstance(node, ast.BoolOp):
    for value in node.values:
        result = self._check_taint_source(value, location)
        if result is not None:
            return result
```

**Impact:** Stage 3.1 (Type System Evaporation) backend_receiver.py now correctly detects
2 vulnerabilities (CWE-20: Unvalidated Input in HTTP Response).

## Gap Analysis: v3.1 to v4.0 (The "Mandatory Scalpel" Problem)

### The Thought Experiment

**Scenario:** v3.1 "Gatekeeper" is deployed. ALL code changes must go through Code Scalpel to merge. Where do agents currently hit walls?

### Identified Walls

| Wall | Description | Impact | Current Status |
|------|-------------|--------|----------------|
| **Language Coverage** | Go, Rust, C#, Kotlin not supported | Agents bypass Scalpel entirely | CRITICAL |
| **Framework Semantics** | React hooks rules, Spring bean lifecycle not understood | "Valid" code that breaks at runtime | HIGH |
| **Test Execution** | Can generate tests but can't verify correctness | Wrong tests ship wrong code | HIGH |
| **Monorepo Support** | No cross-package dependency understanding | Changes break downstream consumers | HIGH |
| **Build System** | Webpack, Vite, bundler implications unknown | Tree-shaking, code splitting breaks | MEDIUM |
| **Database/ORM** | Model changes don't trigger migrations | Data corruption in production | MEDIUM |
| **IaC Semantics** | Terraform, K8s changes not validated | Infrastructure misconfiguration | MEDIUM |
| **Performance** | No Big-O analysis or benchmark integration | Correct but slow code ships | MEDIUM |
| **Documentation** | Code changes without doc updates | Documentation becomes lies | LOW |
| **Cross-Repo** | No multi-repository impact analysis | Breaking changes across services | LOW |

### Strategic Solution: Foundation First

**Key Insight:** Don't mandate usage until capability is complete.

Reordered releases ensure agents never hit "sorry, can't parse that" walls:

```

**Why This Order:**
1. **No escape hatches** - By Gatekeeper, there's no "can't parse Go" excuse
2. **Trust is earned** - Teams use Scalpel because it's useful, then mandate because it's proven
3. **Fewer bypass requests** - Capability precedes enforcement

---

## v3.1.0 - "Polyglot+" (Language Expansion)

### Overview

**Theme:** Universal Coverage  
**Goal:** Expand language support to cover 90% of enterprise codebases  
**Effort:** ~4-6 weeks per language  
**Risk Level:** Medium (proven tree-sitter approach)  
**Target Release:** Q1 2026

### Why This Release

With v3.1 "Gatekeeper" enforcing mandatory Scalpel usage, language gaps become **escape hatches**. If an agent needs to modify a Go file and we can't parse it, they bypass Scalpel entirely—defeating the CI gate's purpose.

**Enterprise Language Distribution (2025 surveys):**
| Language | Enterprise Usage | Current Support |
|----------|------------------|-----------------|
| Python | 72% | ✅ Full |
| JavaScript | 68% | ✅ Full |
| TypeScript | 61% | ✅ Full |
| Java | 54% | ✅ Full |
| **Go** | 38% | ❌ None |
| **C#** | 35% | ❌ None |
| **Kotlin** | 28% | ❌ None |
| **Rust** | 19% | ❌ None |

### Languages to Add

| Language | Priority | Rationale | Parser |
|----------|----------|-----------|--------|
| **Go** | P0 | Kubernetes, cloud-native, Terraform providers | tree-sitter-go |
| **Rust** | P0 | Security-critical systems, growing adoption | tree-sitter-rust |
| **C#** | P1 | Enterprise .NET, Azure ecosystem | tree-sitter-c-sharp |
| **Kotlin** | P1 | Android, Spring Boot, JVM ecosystem | tree-sitter-kotlin |

### Features Planned

| Priority | Feature | Description | Status |
|----------|---------|-------------|--------|
| **P0** | Go Parser | Full AST extraction using tree-sitter-go | Planned |
| **P0** | Go Security Sinks | Detect sql.Query, os.Exec, http.Get sinks | Planned |
| **P0** | Rust Parser | Full AST extraction using tree-sitter-rust | Planned |
| **P0** | Rust Security Sinks | Detect unsafe blocks, FFI calls, Command::new | Planned |
| **P1** | C# Parser | Full AST extraction using tree-sitter-c-sharp | Planned |
| **P1** | C# Security Sinks | Detect SqlCommand, Process.Start, WebClient | Planned |
| **P1** | Kotlin Parser | Full AST extraction using tree-sitter-kotlin | Planned |
| **P1** | Kotlin Security Sinks | Detect Runtime.exec, JDBC, OkHttp | Planned |
| **P2** | Unified Type Graph | Cross-language type correlation | Research |

### Implementation Approach

**Architecture (per language):**
```
tree-sitter-{lang}  →  LangParser  →  IR (IRFunctionDef, IRClass)
                            ↓
                    LangSecurityAnalyzer  →  Taint tracking
                            ↓
                    UnifiedGraph  →  Cross-language linking
```

**Go-Specific Considerations:**
- Multiple return values (error handling pattern)
- Goroutines and channels (concurrency)
- Interface satisfaction (duck typing)
- Build tags and conditional compilation

**Rust-Specific Considerations:**
- Ownership and borrowing (lifetime tracking)
- Traits and implementations
- Macro expansion (procedural macros)
- unsafe blocks (critical for security)

**C#-Specific Considerations:**
- LINQ expressions
- async/await patterns
- Nullable reference types
- Properties vs fields

**Kotlin-Specific Considerations:**
- Null safety operators (?., !!)
- Extension functions
- Coroutines (suspend functions)
- Data classes and sealed classes

### Security Sink Detection

**Go Security Sinks:**
```go
// SQL Injection
db.Query(userInput)           // database/sql
db.Exec(userInput)

// Command Injection
exec.Command(userInput)       // os/exec
os.StartProcess(userInput)

// Path Traversal
os.Open(userInput)
ioutil.ReadFile(userInput)

// SSRF
http.Get(userInput)           // net/http
client.Do(req)                // with user-controlled URL
```

**Rust Security Sinks:**
```rust
// Command Injection
Command::new(user_input)      // std::process
    .arg(user_input)

// SQL Injection (with sqlx/diesel)
sqlx::query(user_input)
diesel::sql_query(user_input)

// Path Traversal
fs::read(user_input)          // std::fs
File::open(user_input)

// Unsafe Code
unsafe { ptr::read(user_input) }  // Any unsafe block with user data
```

## v3.2.0 - "Framework IQ" (Semantic Framework Rules)

### Overview

**Theme:** Deep Understanding  
**Goal:** Add framework-specific semantic rules beyond AST parsing  
**Effort:** ~2-3 weeks per framework  
**Risk Level:** Medium (rule authoring is subjective)  
**Target Release:** Q2 2026

### Why This Release

**The Problem:** AST parsing tells us WHAT code exists, not WHETHER it's correct.

**Example - React Hooks:**
```jsx
// This parses fine but CRASHES at runtime
function Component({ condition }) {
  if (condition) {
    const [state, setState] = useState(0);  // ILLEGAL: Hook in conditional
  }
  return <div />;
}
```

Current Code Scalpel: ✅ Valid JavaScript, approved
Reality: ❌ React crashes with "Hooks can only be called at the top level"

### Framework Rules to Implement

| Framework | Rules | Priority |
|-----------|-------|----------|
| **React** | Hooks rules, component patterns, server/client boundaries | P0 |
| **Next.js** | App router conventions, server actions, 'use client' | P0 |
| **Spring Boot** | Bean lifecycle, @Transactional, @Async | P1 |
| **Django** | Model-migration sync, N+1 detection, signal handlers | P1 |
| **Vue** | Composition API rules, reactivity gotchas | P2 |
| **Angular** | DI tokens, module boundaries, zone.js implications | P2 |
| **Express/NestJS** | Middleware order, guards, interceptors | P2 |
| **FastAPI** | Dependency injection, Pydantic validation | P2 |

### React Rules (Example)

```yaml
# .code-scalpel/framework-rules/react.yaml
framework: react
version: "18.x"

rules:
  - id: hooks-top-level
    severity: error
    message: "Hooks must be called at the top level of a function component"
    pattern: |
      if|while|for|switch {
        useState|useEffect|useContext|useReducer|useCallback|useMemo|useRef
      }
    fix_hint: "Move hook call outside the conditional/loop"

  - id: hooks-dependency-array
    severity: warning
    message: "useEffect dependency array may be missing variables"
    pattern: |
      useEffect(() => {
        // references $VAR
      }, [/* missing $VAR */])
    fix_hint: "Add missing dependencies or use useCallback to memoize"

  - id: server-component-hooks
    severity: error
    message: "Server Components cannot use useState, useEffect, or other client hooks"
    condition: "file lacks 'use client' directive AND file is in app/ directory"
    pattern: "useState|useEffect|useReducer|useContext"
    fix_hint: "Add 'use client' directive or move state to a Client Component"

  - id: use-client-directive-position
    severity: error
    message: "'use client' must be at the top of the file"
    pattern: |
      // any code before
      'use client'
    fix_hint: "Move 'use client' to the first line of the file"
```

### Spring Boot Rules (Example)

```yaml
# .code-scalpel/framework-rules/spring.yaml
framework: spring-boot
version: "3.x"

rules:
  - id: transactional-public
    severity: error
    message: "@Transactional only works on public methods (proxy limitation)"
    pattern: |
      @Transactional
      (private|protected) * methodName()
    fix_hint: "Change method visibility to public"

  - id: circular-autowired
    severity: warning
    message: "Potential circular dependency detected"
    pattern: |
      class A { @Autowired B b; }
      class B { @Autowired A a; }
    fix_hint: "Use @Lazy or refactor to break the cycle"

  - id: async-return-type
    severity: error
    message: "@Async methods should return void or Future"
    pattern: |
      @Async
      (String|int|Object) methodName()  // non-void, non-Future
    fix_hint: "Return CompletableFuture<T> or change to void"

  - id: transactional-rollback
    severity: warning
    message: "@Transactional doesn't rollback on checked exceptions by default"
    pattern: |
      @Transactional
      void method() throws CheckedException
    fix_hint: "Add rollbackFor = Exception.class to @Transactional"
```

## v3.3.0 - "Verified" (Test Execution Integration)

### Overview

**Theme:** Proof of Correctness  
**Goal:** Move from "tests generated" to "tests executed and verified"  
**Effort:** ~6-8 weeks  
**Risk Level:** Medium-High (sandboxed execution is complex)  
**Target Release:** Q2-Q3 2026

### Why This Release

**The Current Gap:**

```
Current Flow:
  Agent generates test → Mutation gate passes → SHIP

Problem:
  Agent introduces bug
  Agent generates test that TESTS THE BUG (not the spec)
  Test passes → Mutation gate passes (reverting breaks the buggy test)
  BUG SHIPS TO PRODUCTION
```

**The Solution:** Actually EXECUTE tests and analyze results.

### Features Planned

| Priority | Feature | Description | Status |
|----------|---------|-------------|--------|
| **P0** | Test Runner Integration | pytest, jest, junit, go test, cargo test | Planned |
| **P0** | Sandboxed Execution | Docker-based isolated test runs | Planned |
| **P0** | Coverage Delta Analysis | Did the change affect covered lines? | Planned |
| **P1** | Test Result Parsing | Extract failures, map to code locations | Planned |
| **P1** | Failure Diagnosis | Explain WHY a test failed | Planned |
| **P1** | Property-Based Testing | Hypothesis/QuickCheck integration | Research |
| **P2** | Flaky Test Detection | Identify non-deterministic tests | Planned |
| **P2** | Test Impact Analysis | Which tests cover the changed code? | Planned |

```

### Coverage Delta Analysis

**Concept:** Compare coverage before and after change.

```python
# Before change
coverage_before = {
    "src/utils.py": {10, 11, 12, 15, 16},  # Covered lines
    "src/api.py": {20, 21, 25, 26, 27}
}

# After change (agent added lines 13-14, modified line 15)
change_diff = {
    "src/utils.py": {
        "added": {13, 14},
        "modified": {15}
    }
}

# After running tests
coverage_after = {
    "src/utils.py": {10, 11, 12, 13, 15, 16},  # Line 14 NOT covered!
    "src/api.py": {20, 21, 25, 26, 27}
}

# Analysis
coverage_delta = analyze_delta(change_diff, coverage_after)
# Result: WARNING - Line 14 added but not covered by tests
```

### Property-Based Testing Integration

**Concept:** Generate edge cases automatically.

```python
# Agent's implementation
def calculate_discount(price: float, percentage: float) -> float:
    return price * (1 - percentage / 100)

# Code Scalpel generates property-based tests
from hypothesis import given, strategies as st

@given(
    price=st.floats(min_value=0, max_value=10000),
    percentage=st.floats(min_value=0, max_value=100)
)
def test_discount_properties(price, percentage):
    result = calculate_discount(price, percentage)
    
    # Property 1: Result should never exceed original price
    assert result <= price
    
    # Property 2: Result should be non-negative
    assert result >= 0
    
    # Property 3: 0% discount = original price
    if percentage == 0:
        assert result == price
    
    # Property 4: 100% discount = 0
    if percentage == 100:
        assert result == 0
```

## v3.4.0 - "Workspace" (Monorepo Support)

### Overview

**Theme:** Scale  
**Goal:** Support monorepos with 50+ packages and cross-package dependencies  
**Effort:** ~6-8 weeks  
**Risk Level:** Medium (complex dependency graphs)  
**Target Release:** Q3 2026

### Why This Release

**The Reality:** Modern codebases aren't single projects.

```

│   ├── shared-utils/        # Used by 47 other packages
│   ├── design-system/       # UI components

│   ├── payment-service/
│   └── notification-service/
└── tools/
    ├── eslint-config/
    └── tsconfig-base/
```

**The Problem:**

Agent modifies `shared-utils/string-helpers.ts`:
- Code Scalpel: ✅ Valid TypeScript, no security issues
- Reality: 47 packages import this → 15 break with the change

### Features Planned

| Priority | Feature | Description | Status |
|----------|---------|-------------|--------|
| **P0** | Workspace Detection | Detect npm/pnpm/yarn workspaces, Cargo, Gradle | Planned |
| **P0** | Cross-Package Graph | Track dependencies between packages | Planned |
| **P0** | Impact Analysis | "This change affects packages X, Y, Z" | Planned |
| **P1** | Affected Test Selection | Only run tests for affected packages | Planned |
| **P1** | Breaking Change Detection | API changes that break consumers | Planned |
| **P1** | Semver Validation | Detect breaking changes in minor/patch | Planned |
| **P2** | Nx/Turborepo Integration | Use existing dep graph if available | Planned |
| **P2** | Lockfile Analysis | Detect dependency version conflicts | Planned |

### Semver Validation

```
Agent's Change:
  - Removed function parameter (breaking)
  - Changed return type (breaking)
  
Package.json says: "1.2.3" → "1.2.4" (patch)

Code Scalpel:
  ❌ BLOCKING: Breaking change requires major version bump
  
  Detected:
  - formatCurrency(amount) → formatCurrency(amount, locale)
    This is a BREAKING change (new required parameter)
  
  Options:
  1. Make 'locale' optional: formatCurrency(amount, locale = 'en-US')
  2. Bump to 2.0.0 and update all consumers
  
  Recommended: Option 1 for backward compatibility
```

### Release Checklist

[ ] npm/yarn/pnpm workspace detection
[ ] Cargo workspace detection
[ ] Gradle multi-project detection
[ ] Cross-package dependency graph
[ ] Impact analysis for changes
[ ] Breaking change detection
[ ] Semver validation
[ ] Affected test selection

## v3.5 → v4.0 Bridge: Pre-Swarm Infrastructure

### Gap Analysis

**v3.5 "Gatekeeper" delivers:** CI/CD enforcement, single-agent governance
**v4.0 "Swarm" requires:** Multi-agent coordination, distributed systems

**Missing Infrastructure:**
| Gap | Problem | Solution Release |
|-----|---------|------------------|
| Agent Identity | No way to distinguish Agent A from Agent B | v3.6 "Identity" |
| Message Protocol | No structured communication between agents | v3.7 "Protocol" |
| Shared State | No real-time state synchronization | v3.8 "Sync" |
| Conflict Detection | No way to detect conflicting edits | v3.9 "Arbitrate" |

---

## v3.6.0 - "Identity" (Agent Authentication & Tracking)

### Overview

**Theme:** Who's Who  
**Goal:** Establish unique identity for each AI agent interacting with Code Scalpel  
**Effort:** ~3-4 weeks  
**Risk Level:** Low (foundation layer)  
**Target Release:** Q1 2027

### Why This Release

Before multiple agents can collaborate, we need to know WHO is doing WHAT:
- **Attribution:** Which agent made this change?
- **Accountability:** Who introduced this bug?
- **Authorization:** Can this agent perform this operation?
- **Audit:** Complete trail of agent actions

### Features Planned

| Priority | Feature | Description | Status |
|----------|---------|-------------|--------|
| **P0** | Agent Registration | Agents register with unique ID, capabilities, role | Planned |
| **P0** | Session Tracking | Track agent sessions with start/end times | Planned |
| **P0** | Action Attribution | Every tool call tagged with agent ID | Planned |
| **P1** | Capability Declaration | Agents declare what they can do (read, write, delete) | Planned |
| **P1** | Agent Fingerprinting | Detect agent type (Claude, Copilot, custom) from behavior | Planned |
| **P2** | Agent Reputation | Track success/failure rates per agent | Research |

### Agent Identity Schema

```json
{
  "agent_id": "agent-claude-opus-7b2f3a",
  "agent_type": "claude",
  "model_version": "claude-3-opus-20240229",
  "session_id": "sess-2027-01-15-abc123",
  "role": "backend_developer",
  "capabilities": ["read", "write", "execute_tests"],
  "restrictions": ["no_delete", "no_auth_changes"],
  "registered_at": "2027-01-15T10:00:00Z",
  "trust_level": 0.85,
  "parent_session": null
}
```

### Release Checklist

[ ] Agent registration API
[ ] Session management (create, extend, terminate)
[ ] Action attribution in audit log
[ ] Capability declaration schema
[ ] Agent fingerprinting heuristics
[ ] Trust level calculation
[ ] Integration with v3.5 Gatekeeper policies

## v3.7.0 - "Protocol" (Inter-Agent Communication)

### Overview

**Theme:** The Language  
**Goal:** Define structured message protocol for agents to communicate intents and claims  
**Effort:** ~4-5 weeks  
**Risk Level:** Medium (protocol design)  
**Target Release:** Q1 2027

### Why This Release

Agents need to communicate before v4.0 Swarm can coordinate them:
- **Intent Declaration:** "I'm about to modify User.java"
- **Resource Claims:** "I need exclusive access to auth/ directory"
- **Status Updates:** "I've finished the frontend component"
- **Dependency Requests:** "I need Backend Agent to expose this API first"

### Message Types

```yaml
message_types:
  # Intent messages
  intent_declare:
    description: "Agent announces planned action"
    fields: [agent_id, action_type, target_files, estimated_duration]
    
  intent_withdraw:
    description: "Agent cancels planned action"
    fields: [agent_id, intent_id, reason]
  
  # Resource messages
  resource_claim:
    description: "Agent requests exclusive access"
    fields: [agent_id, resource_path, claim_type, timeout]
    claim_types: [exclusive, shared_read, shared_write]
    
  resource_release:
    description: "Agent releases claimed resource"
    fields: [agent_id, resource_path, changes_made]
  
  # Coordination messages
  dependency_request:
    description: "Agent needs something from another agent"
    fields: [from_agent, to_agent, dependency_type, details]
    
  dependency_fulfilled:
    description: "Agent confirms dependency is ready"
    fields: [from_agent, to_agent, dependency_id, artifact]
  
  # Status messages
  status_update:
    description: "Agent reports progress"
    fields: [agent_id, task_id, status, progress_pct, details]
    statuses: [started, in_progress, blocked, completed, failed]
```

## v3.8.0 - "Sync" (Real-Time State Synchronization)

### Overview

**Theme:** The Shared Brain  
**Goal:** Enable real-time synchronization of codebase state across multiple agents  
**Effort:** ~5-6 weeks  
**Risk Level:** Medium-High (distributed state)  
**Target Release:** Q2 2027

### Why This Release

Multiple agents need consistent view of codebase state:
- Agent A modifies `User.java` → Agent B must see the change immediately
- Agent C queries call graph → Must include Agent A's recent changes
- Agent D runs security scan → Must analyze latest code, not stale cache

### Features Planned

| Priority | Feature | Description | Status |
|----------|---------|-------------|--------|
| **P0** | State Events | Emit events on every codebase change | Planned |
| **P0** | Event Subscription | Agents subscribe to relevant events | Planned |
| **P0** | Graph Invalidation | Invalidate cached analysis on changes | Planned |
| **P1** | Incremental Updates | Send diffs, not full state | Planned |
| **P1** | Causal Ordering | Ensure events processed in correct order | Planned |
| **P2** | Snapshot/Restore | Point-in-time state snapshots | Planned |

### Event Types

```yaml
events:
  file_created:
    fields: [path, content_hash, created_by, timestamp]
    
  file_modified:
    fields: [path, old_hash, new_hash, modified_by, diff, timestamp]
    
  file_deleted:
    fields: [path, deleted_by, timestamp]
    
  symbol_added:

## v3.9.0 - "Arbitrate" (Conflict Detection & Resolution)

### Overview

**Theme:** The Referee  
**Goal:** Detect and resolve conflicts when multiple agents modify the same code  
**Effort:** ~5-6 weeks  
**Risk Level:** High (correctness critical)  
**Target Release:** Q2 2027

### Why This Release

With multiple agents writing to the same codebase, conflicts are inevitable:
- Two agents modify same function simultaneously
- One agent deletes code another is extending
- API changes break dependent code

v3.9 detects these conflicts BEFORE they corrupt the codebase.

### Conflict Types & Resolution

| Conflict Type | Detection | Resolution |
|---------------|-----------|------------|
| **Write-Write** | Same symbol modified by 2+ agents | Merge if compatible, escalate if not |
| **Write-Delete** | Agent A modifies, Agent B deletes | Always escalate to human |
| **Rename-Reference** | Agent A renames symbol, Agent B adds reference | Auto-update reference |
| **Signature-Call** | Agent A changes signature, Agent B calls old | Block until B updates |
| **Semantic** | Both changes valid, but combined breaks tests | Detect via test execution |

### Features Planned

| Priority | Feature | Description | Status |
|----------|---------|-------------|--------|
| **P0** | Conflict Detection | Detect conflicts before they occur | Planned |
| **P0** | Lock Management | Symbol-level and file-level locks | Planned |
| **P0** | Escalation Queue | Queue conflicts for human resolution | Planned |
| **P1** | Auto-Merge | Automatically merge compatible changes | Planned |
| **P1** | Conflict Preview | Show what would conflict before execution | Planned |
| **P2** | Conflict History | Track past conflicts for pattern analysis | Planned |

### Lock Granularity

```yaml
lock_levels:
  file:
    description: "Entire file locked"
    use_case: "Large refactors, file renames"
    
  symbol:
    description: "Single function/class locked"
    use_case: "Targeted modifications"
    
  region:
    description: "Line range locked"
    use_case: "Multi-symbol changes in one area"
    
  semantic:
    description: "Logical unit locked (e.g., API contract)"
    use_case: "Cross-file consistency"
```

## v4.0.0 - "Swarm" (Multi-Agent Collaboration)

### Overview

**Theme:** The Digital Team  
**Goal:** Coordinate multiple specialized agents (Architect, Security, Frontend, Backend) working on a shared codebase simultaneously  
**Effort:** ~3-4 developer-months  
**Risk Level:** High (complex distributed systems)  
**Target Release:** H2 2026

### Why This Release

Modern AI-assisted development is evolving beyond single-agent interactions. Enterprise teams are deploying **specialized agents** for different roles:
- **Architect Agent:** System design, API contracts, module boundaries
- **Security Agent:** Vulnerability scanning, compliance checking
- **Frontend Agent:** UI components, styling, accessibility
- **Backend Agent:** Business logic, database interactions
- **QA Agent:** Test generation, edge case discovery

**The Problem:** Without coordination, these agents create chaos:
- Agent A modifies `User.java` while Agent B is renaming it → Git conflict
- Security Agent flags a vulnerability that Frontend Agent just introduced → Race condition
- Architect Agent redesigns an API that Backend Agent is implementing → Wasted work

**The Solution:** Shared Graph Memory with Optimistic Locking and Conflict Resolution.

### Features Planned

| Priority | Feature | Description | Status |
|----------|---------|-------------|--------|
| **P0** | Shared Graph Memory | Multiple agents reading/writing to the same UnifiedGraph instance in real-time | Planned |
| **P0** | Optimistic Locking | Prevent Agent A from editing `User.java` while Agent B is renaming it | Planned |
| **P0** | Conflict Resolution Engine | Automatically merge conflicting AST changes from two agents without git conflicts | Planned |
| **P1** | Role-Based Policy | "Architect" agents can delete files; "Junior" agents can only modify implementations | Planned |
| **P1** | Agent Communication Protocol | Structured messages between agents (intents, claims, releases) | Planned |
| **P1** | Deadlock Detection | Detect and resolve circular wait conditions in multi-agent scenarios | Planned |
| **P2** | Agent Priority System | Higher-priority agents can preempt lower-priority ones | Planned |
| **P2** | Consensus Algorithms | Multi-agent agreement on architectural decisions | Planned |
| **P2** | Replay & Audit | Full history of multi-agent interactions for debugging | Planned |

### Shared Graph Memory

**Concept:** A centralized, real-time synchronized UnifiedGraph that all agents read from and write to.

```python
# Agent A (Architect)
async with swarm.acquire_lock("src/models/User.java", mode="write") as lock:
    # Other agents blocked from writing User.java
    user_class = await swarm.graph.get_class("User")
    user_class.add_method("getFullName", return_type="String")
    await swarm.graph.commit(lock)

# Agent B (Security) - concurrent read allowed
user_methods = await swarm.graph.get_methods("User")  # Sees getFullName after commit
```

### Optimistic Locking

**Lock Modes:**
| Mode | Read | Write | Delete | Use Case |
|------|------|-------|--------|----------|
| `read` | ✅ | ❌ | ❌ | Scanning, analysis |
| `write` | ✅ | ✅ | ❌ | Modifying implementations |
| `exclusive` | ✅ | ✅ | ✅ | Renaming, restructuring |

**Lock Granularity:**
- **File-level:** Lock entire file for major refactoring
- **Symbol-level:** Lock specific function/class for surgical edits
- **Line-level:** Lock specific line ranges (experimental)

**Conflict Resolution:**
```python
# Agent A claims User.java for write
# Agent B attempts to claim User.java for write

try:
    async with swarm.acquire_lock("User.java", mode="write", timeout=30):
        # Work on file
except LockConflictError as e:
    # Option 1: Wait for Agent A to release
    await swarm.wait_for_release("User.java", timeout=60)
    
    # Option 2: Request priority escalation
    await swarm.request_preemption("User.java", reason="security-critical")
    
    # Option 3: Work on different file
    alternative = await swarm.suggest_alternative("User.java")
```

### Role-Based Policy

```yaml
# .code-scalpel/swarm-policy.yaml
roles:
  architect:
    permissions:
      - "create_file"
      - "delete_file"
      - "modify_api"
      - "rename_symbol"
    priority: 100
    can_preempt: ["backend", "frontend", "junior"]
    
  security:
    permissions:
      - "modify_security"
      - "block_deployment"

      - "add_tests"
    priority: 50
    restricted_paths:

  junior:
    permissions:
      - "modify_implementation"
    priority: 10
    requires_review: true
    max_files_per_session: 3
```

### Conflict Resolution Engine

**AST-Level 3-Way Merge:**
```
Base Version (commit abc123):
    def process(data):
        validate(data)
        return transform(data)

Agent A's Change:
    def process(data):
        validate(data)
        log(data)           # Added logging
        return transform(data)

Agent B's Change:
    def process(data):
        validate(data)
        data = sanitize(data)  # Added sanitization
        return transform(data)

Merged Result (automatic):
    def process(data):
        validate(data)
        log(data)           # From Agent A
        data = sanitize(data)  # From Agent B
        return transform(data)
```

**Conflict Types:**
| Type | Description | Resolution |
|------|-------------|------------|
| **Parallel Insert** | Both agents add code at same location | Order by priority, then timestamp |
| **Modify-Delete** | Agent A modifies line, Agent B deletes it | Escalate to human |
| **Semantic Conflict** | Changes compile but break behavior | Detect via test execution |
| **API Contract** | Agent changes signature another depends on | Block until dependents update |

### Research Areas

- **Consensus Protocols:** Raft/Paxos for distributed agreement on architectural decisions
- **Deadlock Prevention:** Banker's algorithm for resource allocation
- **Fairness Guarantees:** Prevent agent starvation in high-contention scenarios
- **Rollback Mechanisms:** Atomic multi-agent transactions with rollback on failure

## v4.0 → v5.0 Bridge: From Collaboration to Transformation

### Gap Analysis

**v4.0 "Swarm" delivers:** Multi-agent collaboration on a SINGLE codebase
**v5.0 "Re-Platforming" requires:** Pattern recognition, transpilation, architectural transformation

**Missing Capabilities:**
| Gap | Problem | Solution Release |
|-----|---------|------------------|
| Pattern Learning | Swarm agents act, but don't learn patterns | v4.1 "Learn" |
| Architecture Awareness | No understanding of architectural styles | v4.2 "Architect" |
| Cross-Language Analysis | Can't compare Java and TypeScript semantics | v4.3 "Rosetta" |
| Change Measurement | No metrics for transformation success | v4.4 "Metrics" |

---

## v4.1.0 - "Learn" (Pattern Recognition Foundation)

### Overview

**Theme:** The Student  
**Goal:** Enable Code Scalpel to learn patterns from existing codebases  
**Effort:** ~5-6 weeks  
**Risk Level:** Medium (ML integration)  
**Target Release:** Q3 2027

### Why This Release

Before we can do Pattern Mining (v5.0), we need basic pattern recognition:
- What does a "Controller" look like in THIS codebase?
- What's the naming convention for services?
- How does error handling typically work here?

v4.1 builds the foundation that v5.0's Pattern Mining will scale up.

### Features Planned

| Priority | Feature | Description | Status |
|----------|---------|-------------|--------|
| **P0** | Code Fingerprinting | Generate fingerprints for code structures | Planned |
| **P0** | Similarity Detection | Find similar code blocks across codebase | Planned |
| **P0** | Pattern Extraction | Extract common patterns from similar code | Planned |
| **P1** | Convention Learning | Learn naming, structure, style conventions | Planned |
| **P1** | Anti-Pattern Detection | Identify code that deviates from patterns | Planned |
| **P2** | Pattern Database | Store and query learned patterns | Planned |

### Pattern Fingerprinting

**Concept:** Transform code into a canonical fingerprint for comparison.

```python
# Input: Two similar functions
def get_user(user_id):
    user = db.query(User).filter_by(id=user_id).first()
    if not user:
        raise NotFoundError("User not found")
    return user

def get_product(product_id):
    product = db.query(Product).filter_by(id=product_id).first()
    if not product:
        raise NotFoundError("Product not found")
    return product

# Fingerprint (abstracted structure)
{
    "structure": "function(param) -> query(Model).filter_by(id=param) -> null_check -> raise_or_return",
    "pattern_type": "repository_get_by_id",
    "variables": {
        "entity_name": ["user", "product"],
        "model_class": ["User", "Product"],
        "id_param": ["user_id", "product_id"]
    },
    "similarity_score": 0.95
}
```

### Convention Learning

```yaml
learned_conventions:
  naming:
    functions:
      - pattern: "get_{entity}"
        purpose: "Retrieve single entity by ID"
        occurrences: 47
      - pattern: "list_{entities}"
        purpose: "Retrieve multiple entities"
        occurrences: 32
      - pattern: "create_{entity}"
        purpose: "Create new entity"
        occurrences: 28
    classes:
      - pattern: "{Entity}Service"
        purpose: "Business logic for entity"
        occurrences: 15
      - pattern: "{Entity}Repository"
        purpose: "Data access for entity"
        occurrences: 15
  structure:
    error_handling:
      pattern: "try-except with specific exceptions"
      occurrences: 120
    dependency_injection:
      pattern: "constructor injection"
      occurrences: 45
```

**Goal:** Understand architectural patterns (MVC, Hexagonal, Microservices, etc.)  
**Effort:** ~5-6 weeks  
**Risk Level:** Medium (domain knowledge)  
**Target Release:** Q3 2027

### Why This Release

Before v5.0 can recommend target architectures, we need to UNDERSTAND architectures:
- Is this codebase MVC or Hexagonal?

| **P0** | Dependency Direction | Verify dependencies point the right way | Planned |
| **P1** | Architecture Conformance | Check if code follows stated architecture | Planned |
| **P1** | Coupling Analysis | Measure coupling between components | Planned |
| **P2** | Architecture Evolution | Track how architecture changed over time | Research |

### Architecture Patterns Recognized

## v4.3.0 - "Rosetta" (Cross-Language Semantic Understanding)

### Overview

**Theme:** The Translator's Dictionary  
**Goal:** Build semantic mappings between programming languages  
**Effort:** ~6-8 weeks  
**Risk Level:** High (semantic complexity)  
**Target Release:** Q4 2027

### Why This Release

v5.0's Language Transpilation needs to understand semantic equivalence:
- Java `List<String>` ≈ TypeScript `string[]`
- Java `Optional<T>` ≈ TypeScript `T | null`
- Java `synchronized` ≈ TypeScript async patterns

v4.3 builds the semantic mapping layer.

### Features Planned

| Priority | Feature | Description | Status |
|----------|---------|-------------|--------|
| **P0** | Type Mapping | Map types between languages | Planned |
| **P0** | Idiom Mapping | Map language idioms to equivalents | Planned |
| **P0** | API Mapping | Map standard library APIs | Planned |
| **P1** | Semantic Diff | Compare semantics across languages | Planned |
| **P1** | Gap Analysis | Identify features with no equivalent | Planned |
| **P2** | Runtime Behavior | Document runtime semantic differences | Research |

### Type Mapping Database

```yaml

  java_to_kotlin:
    primitives:
      int: "Int"
      long: "Long"
      boolean: "Boolean"
      
    nullability:
      "T": "T"  # Non-null by default
      "@Nullable T": "T?"
```

### Idiom Mapping

```yaml

    kotlin: |
      var name: String = ""
    typescript: |
      private _name: string = "";
      get name(): string { return this._name; }
      set name(value: string) { this._name = value; }
      
  java_builder_pattern:
    java: |
      User.builder().name("John").age(30).build()
    kotlin: |
      User(name = "John", age = 30)
    typescript: |
      new User({ name: "John", age: 30 })
      
  java_stream:
    java: |
      list.stream().filter(x -> x > 0).map(x -> x * 2).collect(Collectors.toList())
    kotlin: |
      list.filter { it > 0 }.map { it * 2 }
    typescript: |
      list.filter(x => x > 0).map(x => x * 2)
```

## v4.4.0 - "Metrics" (Transformation Success Measurement)

### Overview

**Theme:** The Scorecard  
**Goal:** Define and measure success metrics for code transformations  
**Effort:** ~4-5 weeks  
**Risk Level:** Low (measurement layer)  
**Target Release:** Q4 2027

### Why This Release

How do we know if a migration succeeded? v4.4 provides the metrics:
- Did we preserve behavior? (functional equivalence)
- Did we maintain performance? (non-functional equivalence)
- Did we reduce complexity? (improvement metrics)
- What's the migration progress? (completion tracking)

### Features Planned

|----------|---------|-------------|--------|
| **P0** | Functional Equivalence | Verify same inputs → same outputs | Planned |
| **P0** | Coverage Metrics | Track what % of code has been migrated | Planned |
| **P0** | Complexity Metrics | Measure complexity before/after | Planned |
| **P1** | Performance Comparison | Benchmark original vs migrated | Planned |
| **P1** | Defect Tracking | Track bugs introduced by migration | Planned |
| **P2** | Business Metrics | Map technical metrics to business value | Research |

## v5.0.0 - "Re-Platforming" (Legacy Migration)

### Overview

**Theme:** The Phoenix  
**Goal:** Automated architectural transformation at scale (e.g., Monolith to Microservices, Java to Kotlin)  
**Effort:** ~6-12 developer-months  
**Risk Level:** Very High (complex transformations)  
**Target Release:** 2027+

### Why This Release

Enterprise codebases accumulate **technical debt** over decades:
- **Monolithic architectures** that can't scale
- **Legacy languages** (COBOL, VB6, Java 8) that can't attract talent
- **Tightly coupled modules** that can't be deployed independently
- **Inconsistent patterns** that make maintenance costly

**Manual migration is expensive:** Consultants estimate 18-24 months and $10M+ for large migrations.

**The Solution:** AI-driven pattern mining, automated transformation, and semantic-preserving transpilation.

### Features Planned

| Priority | Feature | Description | Status |
|----------|---------|-------------|--------|
| **P0** | Pattern Mining | AI scans 1M+ lines of code to learn "How this company writes Controllers" | Research |
| **P0** | Strangler Fig Automation | Automatically extract a module into a microservice, generate API glue, update call sites | Research |
| **P0** | Language Transpilation | AST-to-AST translation with semantic preservation (e.g., Java Class → TypeScript Interface) | Research |
| **P1** | Architecture Recommender | Analyze codebase and recommend target architecture based on patterns | Planned |
| **P1** | Migration Planner | Generate step-by-step migration plan with effort estimates | Planned |
| **P1** | Regression Test Generator | Auto-generate tests to verify semantic preservation | Planned |
| **P2** | COBOL-to-Java Translator | Specialized transpiler for mainframe modernization | Research |
| **P2** | Database Schema Evolution | Migrate database schemas alongside code changes | Research |
| **P2** | API Versioning Automation | Generate versioned APIs during migration | Planned |

### Pattern Mining

**Concept:** Learn the "house style" of a codebase by analyzing millions of lines.

```python
# Input: 500 Controller classes in a legacy monolith
patterns = await scalpel.mine_patterns(
    codebase="/legacy/src",
    pattern_type="controller",
    min_occurrences=10
)

# Output: Discovered patterns
{
    "controller_structure": {
        "annotations": ["@RestController", "@RequestMapping"],
        "common_methods": ["get*", "post*", "delete*"],
        "injection_style": "constructor",  # vs field injection
        "error_handling": "global_exception_handler",
        "response_wrapper": "ResponseEntity<ApiResponse<T>>"
    },
    "naming_conventions": {
        "controller_suffix": "Controller",
        "service_suffix": "Service",
        "method_prefix_get": "get|find|fetch",
        "method_prefix_create": "create|add|save"
    },
    "code_organization": {
        "package_by": "feature",  # vs layer
        "test_location": "same_package",
        "dto_location": "separate_module"
    }
}
```

**Use Cases:**
- **Consistency Enforcement:** New code must follow discovered patterns
- **Migration Templates:** Generate target architecture based on patterns
- **Technical Debt Detection:** Flag code that deviates from patterns

### Strangler Fig Automation

**Concept:** Incrementally replace a monolith with microservices without big-bang rewrites.

└────────────┘  └────────────┘  └────────────┘  └────────────┘
```

**Automated Steps:**
1. **Dependency Analysis:** Map all calls into/out of Users Module
2. **Interface Extraction:** Generate API contract from internal calls
3. **Service Generation:** Create microservice skeleton with extracted code
4. **Glue Code:** Generate adapter classes for monolith ↔ service communication
5. **Call Site Update:** Replace direct calls with HTTP/gRPC calls
6. **Test Migration:** Move relevant tests to new service
7. **Data Migration:** Generate database split scripts

### Language Transpilation

**Concept:** AST-to-AST translation that preserves semantics, not just syntax.

```
Java Source:                          TypeScript Output:
public class User {                   export class User {
    private String name;                  private name: string;
    private int age;                      private age: number;
    
    public User(String name, int age) {   constructor(name: string, age: number) {
        this.name = name;                     this.name = name;
        this.age = age;                       this.age = age;
    }                                     }
    
    public String getName() {             getName(): string {
        return this.name;                     return this.name;
    }                                     }
    
    public boolean isAdult() {            isAdult(): boolean {
        return this.age >= 18;                return this.age >= 18;
    }                                     }
}                                     }
```

**Semantic Preservation Guarantees:**
- **Type Safety:** Java generics → TypeScript generics with runtime checks
- **Null Safety:** Java `@Nullable` → TypeScript `| null` union types
- **Exception Handling:** Java checked exceptions → TypeScript error types
- **Concurrency:** Java `synchronized` → TypeScript async/await patterns

**Supported Transformations:**
| Source | Target | Complexity | Status |
|--------|--------|------------|--------|
| Java 8 → Java 17 | Upgrade | Low | Planned |
| Java → Kotlin | Same ecosystem | Medium | Planned |
| Java → TypeScript | Cross-platform | High | Research |
| Python 2 → Python 3 | Upgrade | Medium | Planned |
| JavaScript → TypeScript | Type safety | Low | Planned |
| COBOL → Java | Legacy modernization | Very High | Research |

### Research Areas

- **Semantic Equivalence Proofs:** Formally verify that transpiled code has identical behavior
- **Runtime Behavior Matching:** Execute original and transpiled code in parallel, compare outputs
- **Incremental Migration:** Support partial migrations with mixed-language interop
- **Performance Preservation:** Ensure transpiled code doesn't degrade performance

## v5.1.0 - "Intercept" (MCP Proxy Layer)

### Overview

**Theme:** The Router  
**Goal:** Build the transparent interception layer that routes ALL AI tool calls through Code Scalpel  
**Effort:** ~4-6 developer-months  
**Risk Level:** Medium (protocol complexity)  
**Target Release:** Q1 2028

### Why This Release

**The Gap:** Currently, AI agents can call file system tools directly, bypassing Code Scalpel entirely. The Surgical Suite requires ALL operations to flow through a central router.

**The Solution:** An MCP proxy that sits between AI agents and the actual MCP servers, intercepting, analyzing, and governing every tool call.

```

### Tool Classification

The router must understand tool semantics to govern appropriately:

| Tool Category | Examples | Governance Level |
|---------------|----------|------------------|

## v5.2.0 - "Intent" (Intent Analysis & Risk ML)

### Overview

**Theme:** The Brain  
**Goal:** Automatically understand WHAT the AI is trying to do and assess risk level  
**Effort:** ~4-6 developer-months  
**Risk Level:** Medium-High (ML model quality)  
**Target Release:** Q2 2028

### Why This Release

**The Gap:** The router (v5.1) can intercept requests, but doesn't UNDERSTAND them. It sees "replace_string_in_file" but doesn't know if that's adding a log statement (LOW risk) or modifying authentication (CRITICAL risk).

**The Solution:** Intent analysis that parses the AI's actions to understand the semantic meaning, followed by ML-based risk assessment.

### Intent Classification

```
Raw Tool Call:
  tool: "replace_string_in_file"
  params:
    filePath: "/src/auth/jwt.py"
    oldString: "def verify_token(token):"
    newString: "def verify_token(token, skip_validation=False):"

Intent Analysis:
  intent_type: "modify_function_signature"
  semantic_domain: "authentication"
  change_type: "add_parameter"
  parameter_name: "skip_validation"
  parameter_default: "False"
  
Risk Assessment:
  level: "CRITICAL"
  factors:
    - "authentication_domain"
    - "security_bypass_pattern" (skip_validation)
    - "function_signature_change"
  confidence: 0.94
  recommendation: "REQUIRE_HUMAN_APPROVAL"
```

## v5.5.0 - "Extensions" (IDE Integrations)

### Overview

**Theme:** The Experience  
**Goal:** Native IDE extensions that bring Surgical Suite governance into the developer workflow  
**Effort:** ~5-6 developer-months  
**Risk Level:** Medium (multi-platform development)  
**Target Release:** Q1 2029

### Why This Release

**The Gap:** The Surgical Suite works, but developers interact with it through AI chat interfaces. Native IDE integration provides:
- Visual risk indicators in the editor
- One-click approvals without leaving the IDE
- Real-time audit trail in a panel
- Configuration management in settings

### The Vision: Vibe Coding with Executive Function

**The Problem with "Vibe Coding" Today:**

```
Developer: "Hey Claude, add authentication to my API"
                    ↓
Claude: [edits 15 files, adds dependencies, changes configs]
                    ↓
Result: ??? (No audit trail, no verification, no governance)
```

**The Surgical Suite Vision:**

### Core Principles

| Principle | Definition | Implementation |
|-----------|------------|----------------|
| **Transparent Interception** | All AI file operations route through Scalpel | MCP proxy layer, IDE hooks |
| **Executive Function** | AI must plan before acting | Intent declaration, scope estimation |
| **Human-in-the-Loop** | Critical decisions require approval | Risk-based approval gates |
| **Immutable Audit Trail** | Every action cryptographically logged | SHA-256 signed entries |
| **Seamless UX** | Feels like vibe coding, acts like governance | Invisible when safe, visible when risky |

### The "Executive Function" Model

**Inspired by human cognitive control:**

```
Human Executive Function          AI Surgical Executive Function
─────────────────────────         ─────────────────────────────
1. Inhibition (stop impulses)  →  1. Policy Gate (stop policy violations)
2. Working Memory (context)    →  2. Context Awareness (what's in scope)
3. Cognitive Flexibility       →  3. Alternative Paths (offer options)
4. Planning                    →  4. Intent Declaration (state plan first)
5. Monitoring                  →  5. Progress Tracking (audit trail)
```

**Before ANY code operation, AI must:**
1. **Declare Intent:** "I will modify function X in file Y"
2. **Assess Risk:** "This is HIGH_RISK because it affects authentication"
3. **Estimate Scope:** "This will change 3 files with blast radius of 15"
4. **Request Approval:** "Proceed? [Yes/No/Modify]"
5. **Execute with Logging:** Every change recorded with timestamp + hash
6. **Verify Result:** Tests pass, no regressions, security clean

### The "Vibe Coding" Preservation Principle

**Goal:** Make governance invisible when possible, visible when necessary.

**Risk-Based UX:**

| Risk Level | UX Behavior |
|------------|-------------|
| **LOW** | Silent approval, minimal interruption |
| **MEDIUM** | Brief notification: "Modified 3 files in utils/" |
| **HIGH** | Explicit approval: "This changes authentication. Proceed?" |
| **CRITICAL** | Mandatory review: "Security-critical change. Requires human review." |

**Example Session - Seamless LOW Risk:**

```
Developer: "Add a helper function to format dates"
AI: [Silently: Intent=add_function, Scope=1 file, Risk=LOW, Policy=ALLOW]
AI: "Done! Added formatDate() to src/utils/dates.ts"
[Audit log updated, no user interruption]
```

**Example Session - Explicit HIGH Risk:**

```
Developer: "Refactor the database connection pool"
AI: [Analysis: Intent=modify_core, Scope=12 files, Risk=HIGH]

│                                                       │
│ This affects database reliability. Estimated impact: │
│ • 47 API endpoints use this connection pool          │
│ • 3 background workers depend on pool events         │

### Enterprise Integration Points

| Integration | Description | Priority |
|-------------|-------------|----------|
| **SSO/SAML** | Enterprise identity providers | P0 |
| **SIEM** | Export audit logs to Splunk, DataDog, etc. | P0 |
| **RBAC** | Role-based access control for approvals | P0 |
| **Jira/Linear** | Link changes to tickets automatically | P1 |
| **Slack/Teams** | Approval requests via chat | P1 |
| **GitHub/GitLab** | PR annotations with audit summary | P1 |

### Why This is the End Game

**Current State (2025):**
- AI agents are **tools** developers use
- Governance is **opt-in** and often bypassed
- Audit trails are **incomplete** or **non-existent**
- Enterprise adoption is **slow** due to compliance concerns

**Surgical Suite State (2028):**
- AI agents are **governed** by default
- Governance is **invisible** but **always present**
- Audit trails are **complete** and **cryptographically signed**
- Enterprise adoption is **accelerated** because compliance is built-in

**The Ultimate Value Proposition:**

> "Use any AI coding assistant you want. We don't care if it's Claude, Copilot, Cursor, or the next thing. As long as it goes through the Surgical Suite, every action is auditable, every change is verified, and your compliance team sleeps well at night."

### Risk Mitigation Details

#### R10: Graph Explosion (NEW - 3rd Party Review)
**Problem:** Full project graphs can have 50,000+ nodes, exceeding LLM context windows.
**Mitigation:** Graph Neighborhood View extracts k-hop subgraphs (default: 100 nodes max) with confidence-based pruning.
**Acceptance:** Agent receives only relevant nodes for current task.

#### R11: Dynamic Loading Bypass (NEW - 3rd Party Review)
**Problem:** Static AST analysis cannot catch `Class.forName()`, `__import__()`, or `eval()` patterns.
**Mitigation (Partial):** 
- **Implemented:** Strict "Deny Dynamic" static rule flags these patterns
- **Research:** Dynamic Analysis Sandbox (P2, deferred) for runtime verification
**Acceptance:** All dynamic loading patterns flagged with warnings.

#### R12: Java Version Drift (NEW - 3rd Party Review)
**Problem:** New JDK releases may introduce syntax that breaks the parser.
**Mitigation:** Nightly CI job runs parser against JDK Early Access builds.
**Acceptance:** Parser failures detected before JDK GA release.

#### R13: Hollow Fixes (NEW - 3rd Party Review)
**Problem:** Agent may delete functionality to make tests pass (e.g., `def test(): pass`).
**Mitigation:** Mutation Test Gate verifies that reverting the fix causes tests to fail.
**Acceptance:** Fixes rejected if revert doesn't break tests.

#### R14: Tamper Resistance Bypass (NEW - 3rd Party Review)
**Problem:** File permissions (0444) bypassable via `chmod +w`.
**Mitigation:** SHA-256 signed policy manifests stored in git history.
**Acceptance:** Policy modifications detected and operations denied.

#### R15: Multi-Agent Deadlock (v4.0.0 - Swarm)
**Problem:** Multiple agents waiting for each other's locks creates circular wait.
**Mitigation:** 
- Banker's algorithm for deadlock prevention
- Lock timeout with automatic release
- Deadlock detection daemon with forced preemption
**Acceptance:** No deadlock persists longer than 30 seconds.

#### R16: Conflicting Agent Changes (v4.0.0 - Swarm)
**Problem:** Two agents modify same symbol, creating semantic conflicts that AST merge can't resolve.
**Mitigation:**
- Symbol-level locking with optimistic concurrency
- Semantic conflict detection via test execution
- Human escalation for irresolvable conflicts
**Acceptance:** All conflicts either auto-resolved or escalated within 60 seconds.

#### R17: Agent Priority Abuse (v4.0.0 - Swarm)
**Problem:** Malicious agent claims highest priority to monopolize resources.
**Mitigation:**
- Priority assignment controlled by policy file (signed)
- Rate limiting on preemption requests
- Audit trail for all priority escalations
**Acceptance:** No single agent can preempt more than 3 times per minute.

#### R18: Semantic Preservation Failure (v5.0.0 - Re-Platforming)
**Problem:** Transpiled code compiles but has different runtime behavior.
**Mitigation:**
- Dual execution: run original and transpiled code in parallel
- Property-based testing with QuickCheck/Hypothesis
- Formal verification proofs for critical transformations
**Acceptance:** 100% behavior match on existing test suite + fuzz tests.

#### R19: Migration Data Loss (v5.0.0 - Re-Platforming)
**Problem:** Database schema migration loses data during transformation.
**Mitigation:**
- Dry-run mode with data integrity checksums
- Reversible migrations with automatic rollback
- Shadow database verification before cutover
**Acceptance:** Zero data loss tolerance; rollback available for 30 days.

#### R20: Pattern Mining Overfitting (v5.0.0 - Re-Platforming)
**Problem:** Mined patterns are too specific to one codebase, don't generalize.
**Mitigation:**
- Cross-validation against multiple enterprise codebases
- Confidence scoring for pattern applicability
- Human review of top-10 patterns before application
**Acceptance:** Patterns must match 3+ independent codebases with >80% precision.

- Key differentiator: Comprehensive language and framework coverage
- Adoption driver: Works with your entire codebase, not just Python/JS

**v4.x "Swarm":** Position as the **coordination layer** for multi-agent teams.
- Key differentiator: Only tool supporting simultaneous agent collaboration
- Adoption driver: Enterprise teams deploying specialized agent swarms

**v5.x "Re-Platforming":** Become the **migration platform** for legacy modernization.
- Key differentiator: AST-based semantic-preserving transformations
- Adoption driver: $10M+ migration projects become $1M projects

**v6.x "Surgical Suite":** Become the **operating system** for all AI coding.
- Key differentiator: Universal governance layer for ANY AI agent
- Adoption driver: "Use any AI you want—it all goes through the Suite"
- End game: AI coding without governance becomes unthinkable
