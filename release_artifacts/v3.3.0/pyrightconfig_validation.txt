Pyrightconfig.json Configuration Validation
=============================================

File: pyrightconfig.json
Location: /mnt/k/backup/Develop/code-scalpel/pyrightconfig.json
Date: 2026-01-01

VALIDATION RESULTS
==================

✅ FILE VALIDATION
   - File exists: YES
   - Valid JSON: YES
   - File is readable: YES

✅ PYTHON VERSION VALIDATION
   - Configured: 3.10
   - Project requirement: 3.10
   - Match: YES (100%)

✅ TYPE CHECKING MODE
   - Mode: basic
   - Rationale: Appropriate for development phase
   - Status: ACCEPTABLE

✅ INCLUDE PATHS
   - Include: ["src"]
   - Coverage: All source code in src/ directory
   - Status: CORRECT

✅ EXCLUDE PATTERNS
   - **/node_modules - Standard (node dependencies)
   - **/__pycache__ - Standard (Python cache)
   - .git - Standard (version control)
   - src/code_scalpel/code_parsers/** - Intentional (polyglot adapters)
   - Status: APPROPRIATE

✅ STUB CONFIGURATION
   - Stub path: typings
   - Directory exists: YES
   - Extra paths: ["src"]
   - Status: CONFIGURED CORRECTLY

✅ REPORT SETTINGS (Development Phase)
   - reportMissingTypeStubs: false
   - reportUnknownMemberType: false
   - reportUnknownArgumentType: false
   - reportUnknownVariableType: false
   - Rationale: Relaxed settings for v3.3.0 (see type annotation gaps)
   - Status: APPROPRIATE FOR RELEASE

CONFIGURATION CONSISTENCY CHECK
==============================

Pyrightconfig vs .gitignore Alignment:
- .gitignore entries: 143 patterns
- pyrightconfig excludes: 4 patterns
- Common entries: Standard patterns (node_modules, __pycache__, .git)
- Status: CONSISTENT - pyrightconfig includes core exclusions

Reasoning:
- pyrightconfig focuses on type-checking relevant exclusions
- .gitignore is more comprehensive (build artifacts, IDE files, etc.)
- Overlap is appropriate (no conflicts)

OVERALL ASSESSMENT
==================

Configuration Validation: ✅ PASS
Consistency with Project: ✅ PASS
Release Readiness: ✅ APPROVED

Summary:
- pyrightconfig.json is valid and well-configured
- Python version (3.10) matches project requirement
- Exclude patterns are sensible and intentional
- Stub directory properly configured
- Report settings appropriate for v3.3.0 release
- No configuration issues blocking release

Recommendation: ✅ READY FOR RELEASE
