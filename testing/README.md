This directory contains harness artifacts for MCP stdio tool validation.

Files:
- TRACKING.md - living status document updated after test runs
- logs/ - raw request/response logs generated by the harness

Run the primary end-to-end smoke test (requires local Python env):

```bash
PYTHONPATH=src pytest -q tests/mcp/test_mcp_tools_stdio_invocation.py::test_mcp_stdio_invokes_all_tools -s
```

Or run the lightweight harness (spawns server and runs a small smoke set):

```bash
python test-harness/run_tests.py
```

Notes:
- Stdout must remain pure JSON-RPC when interacting with the stdio server; debug prints are logged to stderr by the server.
