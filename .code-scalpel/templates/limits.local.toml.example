# Local Development Overrides (EXAMPLE)
# 
# Copy this to .code-scalpel/limits.local.toml and customize.
# The .local.toml file is gitignored and takes precedence over limits.toml.
#
# Use this for:
#   - Testing features that require higher tiers
#   - Debugging with unlimited limits
#   - Personal development preferences

# ============================================================================
# DEVELOPMENT EXAMPLES
# ============================================================================

# Example 1: Test unlimited depth in Pro tier
[pro.extract_code]
max_depth = 999  # Effectively unlimited for testing

# Example 2: Increase community limits for demos
[community.security_scan]
max_findings = 200  # Show more findings

# Example 3: Test enterprise features in Pro
[pro.symbolic_execute]
max_paths = 100
max_depth = 50

# ============================================================================
# QUICK TIER BOOST (DEVELOPMENT ONLY)

# Uncomment these to give all Community tools Pro-level limits:

# [community.extract_code]
# cross_file_deps = true
# max_depth = 2

# [community.security_scan]
# max_findings = null
# max_file_size_kb = null

# [community.crawl_project]
# max_files = 1000
# parsing_enabled = true
